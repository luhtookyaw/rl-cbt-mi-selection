1. Read the counseling session transcript carefully.
2. Review the evaluation questions and criteria provided below.
3. Assign a score based on the criteria, grading very strictly and uptight. If there is any deficiency, no matter how minor, assign a score of 4 or lower.

[Evaluation Question]
How effectively does the therapist use guided discovery techniques to facilitate client self-reflection and insight?

[criteria]
Score 0: Therapist relied primarily on debate, persuasion, or "lecturing." Therapist seemed to be "cross-examining" patient, putting the patient on the defensive, or forcing his/her point of view on the patient.
Score 2: Therapist relied too heavily on persuasion and debate, rather than guided discovery. However, therapist's style was supportive enough that patient did not seem to feel attacked or defensive.
Score 4: Therapist, for the most part, helped patient see new perspectives through guided discovery (e.g., examining evidence, considering alternatives, weighing advantages and disadvantages) rather than through debate. Used questioning appropriately.
Score 6: Therapist was especially adept at using guided discovery during the session to explore problems and help patient draw his/her own conclusions. Achieved an excellent balance between skillful questioning and other modes of intervention.

Do not forget to give a score strictly and uptight.

Score 6: Therapist seemed to understand the patient’s “internal reality” thoroughly and was adept at communicating this understanding through appropriate verbal and non-verbal responses to the patient (e.g., the tone of the therapist’s response conveyed a sympathetic understanding of the client’s “message”). Excellent listening and empathic skills.
