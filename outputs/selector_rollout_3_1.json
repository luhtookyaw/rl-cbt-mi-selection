      "therapist_last": "Thank you for sharing that specific moment, Caleb. It sounds like that thought, “If this isn’t flawless, I’ll be a failure,” really had a significant impact on your emotions and behaviors during that time. It’s understandable how that kind of pressure could lead to paralysis and ultimately missing the deadline, which only added to your frustration and sense of letting yourself down. \n\nReflecting on how that thought affected you, I’d like to encourage you to consider what evidence supports that belief and what evidence might contradict it. What experiences or outcomes have shown you that perfection isn’t the only measure of success? Exploring this could help us understand how those thoughts have shaped your feelings and actions in the past. How does that sound to you?",
      "client_last": "I appreciate you guiding me to reflect on the evidence around that belief. I guess when I think about it, I’ve had moments where I’ve received positive feedback on my work, even when I didn’t feel it was perfect. Like that time I presented at a conference, and people seemed to connect with my ideas, even though I thought I could have done better. \n\nBut then, I often dismiss those moments, telling myself it was just luck or that people were being nice. I get stuck in that cycle of thinking I have to be perfect to be taken seriously or to validate my work. It’s frustrating because I know deep down that perfection isn’t realistic, yet it feels like my mind keeps going back to that standard. \n\nI guess it’s hard to hold onto those positive moments when the pressure feels so overwhelming. I really want to find a way to remind myself that I can still succeed without everything being flawless. I appreciate you helping me unpack this, but it still feels daunting to challenge those thoughts head-on. I hope it’s okay that I’m still working through this."

Writing down your affirmations and keeping them visible, along with setting reminders, can definitely help reinforce your focus on progress. It’s completely normal to feel hesitant about sticking to the plan consistently, especially when you’re navigating those feelings of overwhelm. \n\nI want to reassure you that it’s okay to experience uncertainty as you work through this process. Remember, building new habits takes time, and it’s perfectly fine to have moments where you might forget or slip back into old patterns. If that happens, it’s an opportunity to gently remind yourself of your new perspective and the progress you’ve made. \n\nAs you move forward, let’s think about how you can track your progress and reflect on your experiences with these strategies. What methods do you think would work best for you in monitoring how you’re doing with your affirmations and celebrating those small victories? How does that feel to consider?",
      "client_last": "I appreciate you reminding me that it's okay to feel uncertain as I navigate this process. It helps to know that building new habits takes time, and I don't have to be perfect right away. \n\nFor tracking my progress, I think it might be useful to keep a journal where I can jot down my thoughts, how I used the affirmations, and any small victories I noticed throughout the week. That way, I can see my progress laid out in front of me, which could help reinforce that sense of accomplishment. \n\nI could also set aside a specific time each week to review what I’ve written and reflect on how I felt about my progress. It would be a good way to celebrate those small wins and remind myself that it's about the journey, not just the end result. \n\nBut I still feel a bit apprehensive about whether I’ll consistently remember to do this. It feels like a lot to manage, and I worry I might slip back into my old habits of perfectionism. I guess I'm just trying to find that balance between being committed to this new approach while also being kind to myself if I don't stick to it perfectly. I really appreciate your support and understanding as I work through these feelings. It feels like a step in the right direction, even if it's daunting."

On one hand, I know those small wins can be a source of motivation, but on the other hand, I worry that if I focus too much on them, I might lose sight of my bigger goals.\n\nThere’s also this fear that if I allow myself to feel satisfied, it might lead to complacency. I keep thinking about how I should be pushing myself harder, and that internal pressure just makes it tough to enjoy any progress I make. It’s frustrating because I want to feel proud of what I accomplish, but I also don’t want to end up feeling stuck again.\n\nI guess it’s just that constant tug-of-war between wanting to be kind to myself and the fear of not living up to my potential. I’m hopeful that by focusing on those small steps, I can start to find that balance. But it still feels daunting, you know? I appreciate you being patient with me as I work through these feelings."

I remember feeling this intense pressure to make everything perfect—the wording, the data, all of it. I kept thinking, “If this isn’t flawless, I’ll be a failure.” That thought just consumed me, and instead of focusing on finishing, I got so caught up in trying to make it perfect that I ended up paralyzed. \n\nI felt like I was letting myself down because I couldn’t meet that impossible standard I set for myself. It was frustrating because I knew I had a lot of good ideas, but that thought of perfectionism overshadowed any progress I could have made. I ended up missing the deadline and felt even worse about myself. It’s like that moment highlighted how crippling those thoughts can be, and I really don’t want to go through that again. \n\nSo, I guess I still wonder how I can approach my work without getting stuck in that cycle again.
