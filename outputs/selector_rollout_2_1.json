I guess I just want them to recognize what I want, but every time I try to bring it up, it feels like I’m walking on eggshells. \n\nI just... I don’t know how to balance what I want with what they want. I feel like if I push back too hard, they’ll get upset, and then it’ll turn into this whole big thing. I don’t want that. I just want some understanding, some support. But it’s like I’m trapped in this cycle where I have to keep compromising, and it’s exhausting.

I don’t want them to be upset, but I also feel like I’m losing a part of myself in all of this.

Additionally, let's explore what factors might have contributed to those moments of openness.

I felt a little hopeful, like maybe they could understand me. It was nice to feel valued, even if it didn’t last long. But those times are overshadowed by all the times I felt dismissed or met with resistance.\n\nI think the openness in those moments came from me just being calm and not coming in too strongly. I wasn’t pushing too hard, and maybe they sensed that. But, honestly, it’s hard to replicate that feeling. I get so anxious thinking about how they might react, and it makes me want to retreat rather than speak up. I guess the evidence against my belief is there, but it feels like a gamble every time I want to express myself.\n\nIf I could somehow channel that calmness more often, maybe I could have more of those positive interactions. But it’s like I can’t shake off the fear of conflict. I want to break free from this cycle, but I don’t know how. Sometimes I just wish things could change without me having to push so hard. It feels like a lot to navigate, and I'm not sure where to start."

Framing your thoughts around the guest list in a way that emphasizes your feelings is a powerful approach.

It’s completely natural to feel a bit daunted, but acknowledging that you deserve to be heard is a significant shift. After the conversation, I encourage you to reflect on how you felt and what you experienced, regardless of the outcome. This reflection can reinforce your progress and help you navigate future discussions. What do you think about setting a small goal for yourself to check in with your feelings afterward?",

I felt a little hopeful, like maybe they could understand me. It was nice to feel valued, even if it didn’t last long. But those times are overshadowed by all the times I felt dismissed or met with resistance.\n\nI think the openness in those moments came from me just being calm and not coming in too strongly. I wasn’t pushing too hard, and maybe they sensed that. But, honestly, it’s hard to replicate that feeling. I get so anxious thinking about how they might react, and it makes me want to retreat rather than speak up. I guess the evidence against my belief is there, but it feels like a gamble every time I want to express myself.\n\nIf I could somehow channel that calmness more often, maybe I could have more of those positive interactions. But it’s like I can’t shake off the fear of conflict. I want to break free from this cycle, but I don’t know how. Sometimes I just wish things could change without me having to push so hard. It feels like a lot to navigate, and I'm not sure where to start."
