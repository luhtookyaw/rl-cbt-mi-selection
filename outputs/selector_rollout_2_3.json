I can feel my heart racing just talking about it, honestly. \n\nLooking back, I can’t say there’s been a clear pattern where he’s always disappointed me every time I’ve tried to express something. There have definitely been moments when I’ve avoided sharing my feelings just to keep things smooth, and that usually leads to me feeling frustrated and trapped. It’s like I’m living under this pressure to be the “good son” who doesn’t rock the boat, but I also feel resentful about it.\n\nI guess there have been times when I have shared something that felt risky, and he didn’t react as badly as I thought he would. But then again, I can’t shake this feeling that if I push too hard, it might end up causing a rift. It’s like my mind is constantly balancing this fear of disappointing him with the desire to be honest. I want to believe he could be more understanding than I think, but it’s just hard to see that when I’m so caught up in this cycle of worry. I don’t know, it all feels like a bit of a mess right now."

There were moments when he actually listened and tried to understand where I was coming from. I remember one time I wanted to change the venue for a family gathering, and at first, I was terrified to bring it up. But when I did, he surprised me by being really supportive. \n\nI guess that shows that maybe I’m not always going to face disappointment, even if that’s the narrative I keep telling myself. It’s just that when I think of the wedding list, I can’t help but feel like it's a bigger deal, you know? Like it carries more weight somehow. \n\nAs for evidence against the belief that I have to keep him happy, I mean, I realize that avoiding tough conversations doesn't really help either. It usually just leads to more frustration and resentment on my end. I've seen that pattern play out too many times, and it just reinforces this feeling of being trapped. I want to break out of that cycle, but it’s tough to see a way forward without feeling like I'm risking something. \n\nSo, maybe reflecting on those positive moments could help me shift my perspective a bit.

I could use a light tone and say something like, “I’ve been thinking about the wedding list, and I’d love to get your thoughts on it.” That might ease some of the tension and create a more open atmosphere.\n\nThen, there’s the option of writing him a note or sending a text beforehand to give him a heads-up. I could say, “I’d like to discuss the wedding list with you when you have some time. It’s important to me.” That could take off some pressure since it gives him time to process it before we actually talk.\n\nFor the pros and cons, starting the conversation in a relaxed setting could feel more natural, but I worry that it might get interrupted or that I won’t have his full attention. Bringing it up during a family gathering might be easier, but it also risks making it feel like a bigger deal than it is, and I might not get the depth of conversation I want. Writing a note could allow me to express myself clearly, but it might also feel impersonal, and he could misinterpret my tone.\n\nSo, I guess it’s about finding the right balance between feeling comfortable and ensuring he understands that this is important to me.

      "therapist_last": "It’s wonderful to see you brainstorming different approaches to initiate this conversation, Blaise. Each option you've considered has its own merits and challenges. Starting in a relaxed setting seems like a great way to create a comfortable atmosphere, while bringing it up during a family gathering could foster a sense of connection, albeit with some risks. Writing a note or sending a text offers clarity, but I understand your concern about it feeling impersonal. \n\nLet’s prioritize these strategies based on your comfort level and the likelihood of achieving a positive outcome. Which of these options feels most manageable for you, and why? Additionally, do you have any specific strategies in mind to help you stay grounded and focused during the conversation, regardless of the approach you choose? Lastly, what support do you think you might need from me as you prepare for this discussion?",
      "client_last": "I think starting in a relaxed setting feels like the most manageable option for me. It just seems less intimidating and allows for a more natural flow of conversation. If we’re both in a good mood, I think it could help ease some of the anxiety I feel about bringing it up. I can also gauge his response better in that kind of environment, which is important to me.\n\nTo stay grounded during the conversation, I could remind myself to breathe and focus on the points I want to express. Perhaps I could even write down a few key thoughts beforehand to keep me on track. I know I have a tendency to get flustered, especially if I feel nervous, so having a little outline might help me keep my focus.\n\nAs for support, I think just having you check in with me after this session would be helpful. Maybe we could talk about how it went and process any feelings that come up afterward. I just want to make sure I can reflect on it and not feel overwhelmed again. It feels like a big step, and having that support would definitely help me feel more prepared."

I remember one time I wanted to change the venue for a family gathering, and at first, I was terrified to bring it up. But when I did, he surprised me by being really supportive. \n\nI guess that shows that maybe I’m not always going to face disappointment, even if that’s the narrative I keep telling myself. It’s just that when I think of the wedding list, I can’t help but feel like it's a bigger deal, you know? Like it carries more weight somehow. \n\nAs for evidence against the belief that I have to keep him happy, I mean, I realize that avoiding tough conversations doesn't really help either. It usually just leads to more frustration and resentment on my end. I've seen that pattern play out too many times, and it just reinforces this feeling of being trapped. I want to break out of that cycle, but it’s tough to see a way forward without feeling like I'm risking something. \n\nSo, maybe reflecting on those positive moments could help me shift my perspective a bit.

How do you think those past positive reactions could influence your approach to the wedding list conversation?

I mean, with the venue change, I was so nervous, but he listened and even supported me, which felt good. I guess that could give me a bit of hope that if I express my thoughts about the wedding list, he might surprise me again. \n\nI could try to remind myself of those moments before I have the conversation. Maybe I could even frame it as a chance for me to share something important to me rather than a confrontation. That could help shift my focus from worrying about disappointing him to just being honest about my needs. \n\nI know avoiding tough conversations hasn’t worked out for me. It just keeps me feeling stuck, and I don’t want to go down that road again. So, maybe thinking about those positive reactions can help me feel a bit more confident, even if it’s just a small step. It’s just a little daunting, but I guess it’s worth trying to break that cycle of anxiety."

I guess it could lead to a more honest conversation, and maybe even help us connect better as a family.\n\nAs for how to express my needs, I could start by saying something like, \"I really want to share my thoughts about the wedding list because it's important to me, and I value your opinion.\" Framing it that way might help ease some of the tension I feel. I could also try to explain why certain choices mean a lot to me, which might help him understand where I’m coming from.\n\nBut I still have fears about this new perspective. Like, what if he doesn’t react the way I hope he will? What if he feels hurt or disapproving anyway? I guess I need to remind myself that I can’t control his reaction, and that’s okay. Maybe focusing on how I express myself and being clear about my feelings can help mitigate that fear. It’s definitely scary, but it feels like a necessary step to take, even if it’s daunting.

It’s more about sharing my perspective and hoping for understanding, rather than expecting him to react perfectly.\n\nI think having those more balanced thoughts could help lower my anxiety and give me the confidence to speak up.

I could say, “Hey, Dad, can we sit down for a minute? There’s something I’d like to talk about regarding the wedding list.” That way, it feels more casual and less like a big deal.\n\nAnother option might be to bring it up during a family gathering when everyone’s in a good mood. I could use a light tone and say something like, “I’ve been thinking about the wedding list, and I’d love to get your thoughts on it.” That might ease some of the tension and create a more open atmosphere.\n\nThen, there’s the option of writing him a note or sending a text beforehand to give him a heads-up. I could say, “I’d like to discuss the wedding list with you when you have some time. It’s important to me.” That could take off some pressure since it gives him time to process it before we actually talk.\n\nFor the pros and cons, starting the conversation in a relaxed setting could feel more natural, but I worry that it might get interrupted or that I won’t have his full attention. Bringing it up during a family gathering might be easier, but it also risks making it feel like a bigger deal than it is, and I might not get the depth of conversation I want. Writing a note could allow me to express myself clearly, but it might also feel impersonal, and he could misinterpret my tone.\n\nSo, I guess it’s about finding the right balance between feeling comfortable and ensuring he understands that this is important to me. I just want to make sure I’m approaching it in a way that keeps the door open for a good conversation. "
