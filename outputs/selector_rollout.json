Like maybe watching a show or reading something that pulls me in so I’m not constantly thinking about how my cousin might react. I could also remind myself to focus on the positive side of things, like the fact that I took a step to communicate instead of just avoiding it. \n\nMaybe I could even jot down a few affirmations or reminders about why I did this, just to keep me grounded. Something like, \"I did this for myself,\" or \"It’s okay to feel anxious, but I’m moving forward.\" I think having that little bit of self-compassion will help me through the waves of anxiety that might come up. It’s like I need to give myself permission to feel whatever comes, but also to celebrate that I took action, even if it feels small. I guess it’s about finding that balance between acknowledging my feelings and not letting them take over."
