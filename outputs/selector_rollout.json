They’re all looking down on you.” That thought just spiraled. I ended up saying something vague to brush it off, but inside, I felt so small and unworthy. It was like I was just a disappointment to everyone, and I couldn’t shake that feeling for days afterward.\n\nThinking about the wedding, it’s like I’m bracing myself for that same kind of judgment.

I remember feeling like I had to keep my head down, avoid eye contact, and just hope I wouldn’t be asked anything too personal. It’s like I’m stuck in this loop where I can’t break free from those feelings of inadequacy. \n\nIf a friend came to me feeling this way, I’d probably remind them that everyone has their struggles and that they’re not defined by those moments of doubt. I’d encourage them to see their value beyond what others might think. But when it’s me, I just can’t seem to apply that same kindness to myself.

Those times where I felt accepted, where I could just be myself, remind me that there are people out there who value me for who I am. If I could approach this situation with that same kindness I’d offer a friend, I’d probably tell myself that it’s okay to feel anxious and that I deserve to be there just as much as anyone else. I mean, I’d remind myself that my worth isn’t determined by my family’s opinions or judgments.\n\nBut it’s tough to really believe that for myself when the fear feels so overwhelming. I guess I keep getting caught in this cycle of wanting to connect but being terrified of the judgment, and it just leaves me feeling stuck. I wish I could find a way to break through that barrier and see the wedding as a chance to reconnect instead of a setup for more disappointment. It’s frustrating, and I just wish I could see things differently."

Those experiences challenge that belief because they remind me that I can be accepted for who I am, not just for my achievements or my weight. But they seem so fleeting compared to those heavy moments with family.\n\nThinking about the wedding, that thought just magnifies my anxiety.

I could reach out to relatives, ask how they’ve been, and share some stories of my own. It feels nice to think that I could add to the atmosphere rather than feel like I’m just there to be judged.\n\nAs for the affirmations, I think writing down things like “I am worthy of love and acceptance just as I am” or “My presence matters and I have a lot to offer” could resonate with me. Reminding myself that I’m not defined by my family’s expectations might help counter that nagging voice that tells me I won’t measure up. I guess having those affirmations to lean on could give me a little boost when those anxious thoughts start creeping in.\n\nI like the idea of focusing on the joy of connection instead of the fear of judgment, but it’s definitely still a work in progress. I just wish I could fully embrace that mindset without feeling overwhelmed. It’s frustrating because I really want to be part of things, and I hope that by preparing in this way, I can navigate through the anxiety and embrace the opportunity for connection."
