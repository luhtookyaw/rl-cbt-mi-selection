I don’t know, it feels like I’m stuck between wanting to protect myself and wanting to be part of something.\n\nAs for the evidence, I mean, I guess I could say it’s mostly based on my past experiences. I can’t think of a time where I felt accepted or not judged at family gatherings. So, it’s hard to believe that this time would be any different.

      "therapist_last": "I appreciate your honesty in sharing those feelings, Alex. When you think about the belief that you might be a disappointment, can you identify specific instances from your past that seem to support that thought? It’s also important to consider any evidence that might contradict it. Reflecting on how these thoughts have influenced your feelings and decisions could be helpful too. How have they shaped your experiences at family gatherings? Lastly, let’s explore alternative interpretations of those past experiences—what might you say to yourself to reframe your belief about attending the wedding based on the evidence you’ve shared?",
      "client_last": "I mean, it's tough to pinpoint specific instances that support that thought without it feeling like a long list of failures, you know? Like, every family gathering feels like a reminder of my shortcomings. There’s that reunion where my mom’s comment just made me feel so small, and then there’s the time at a holiday dinner when I overheard family members talking about their careers and I just felt invisible. Those moments just stick with me. \n\nBut I guess there are also times when people have been kind, even if they feel overshadowed. Like, my aunt once told me she admired my determination in getting through rehab, and that felt nice, but it’s like those moments get drowned out by everything else. \n\nI think the way these thoughts influence my feelings is that they just create this loop of shame and anxiety. I keep replaying those past experiences, and it feels impossible to break out of that cycle of feeling like I’m not good enough. \n\nAs for alternative interpretations, I guess I could tell myself that being imperfect is part of being human, and that I’m allowed to take up space just like everyone else. I could remind myself that I’m trying to do better, and maybe that’s worth something. But then I also feel like that’s just me trying to make excuses for myself. It’s exhausting to think about all of this, and sometimes it just feels easier to avoid the whole situation altogether. I don’t know how to shift my perspective when the old thoughts just keep coming back."

Maybe I’m not a total disappointment. I’ve worked hard to get through rehab, and I’ve been trying to make changes in my life. So I suppose there’s some evidence that contradicts that belief, even if it feels overshadowed.\n\nIf I could reframe it, maybe I could tell myself that it’s okay not to be perfect and that I have value just as I am, regardless of how my family views me. It might help to remember that I’m not alone in feeling out of place at times, and everyone has their struggles. \n\nThinking about that new perspective... I wonder if it could make me feel a bit lighter about the wedding. Maybe I could focus on the idea that I’m there to connect with family and enjoy the celebration, instead of worrying about their judgments. It’s definitely a shift, and I’d like to think it might help reduce some of that anxiety.

Let’s brainstorm some potential strategies to help you manage those situations effectively. For instance, when you walk into the venue, what small grounding technique could you use to help ease that initial wave of anxiety? \n\nRegarding small talk, could you prepare a few simple responses or topics to discuss that feel comfortable for you? This might help alleviate some of the pressure you feel to come up with something on the spot. \n\nAs for those moments when you start to feel overwhelmed, what small, manageable steps could you take to create a plan for how to handle those feelings? Perhaps identifying a quiet space to step away to or a supportive person you can connect with might help. Let’s work together to create a plan that feels achievable for you as you prepare for the wedding.",
      "client_last": "Well, I think for walking into the venue, maybe I could focus on my breathing. Like, just take a few deep breaths before I step in, maybe even count to three as I breathe in and out. I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious, and that I’m just there to support my cousin. \n\nFor small talk, I could definitely prepare a few simple topics or questions in advance. Like, I could ask how people have been or mention something light about the wedding itself. Having something ready might take off some of the pressure to come up with something clever on the spot. \n\nAs for those overwhelming moments, I guess I could identify a quiet corner to step away to if I start feeling really anxious. Just having a plan for that might help me feel less trapped. And maybe I could look for a family member I feel comfortable with to talk to if I need that support. Just knowing I have a way out if things get too much might help ease some of that panic. \n\nBut even with these plans, I still worry about the moments when I might just freeze up or get overwhelmed. It feels good to think about these strategies, but I just hope I can remember to actually use them when I need to. It’s all a bit daunting, you know?"

Whenever I think about going to the wedding, I just feel this wave of sadness and anxiety wash over me. It’s like I can almost feel that weight on my chest, you know? I just don’t want to feel that way again.\n\nAs for evidence, I mean, I know I’ve had those tough experiences before, and my mom's comments just seem to confirm that belief. But at the same time, I know I’ve been trying to make changes in my life, and maybe that should count for something. It’s just hard to hold onto that when the negative thoughts feel so strong.\n\nI think the thing is, I struggle to remember any times where I felt truly accepted. They’re just so overshadowed by all the critical moments. Maybe part of me knows that my mom's views are her own, but they still echo so loudly in my head. It’s frustrating because I want to be able to challenge those thoughts, but they feel so ingrained, like they’re just part of who I am now.\n\nI guess alternative perspectives could be that I deserve to be there, just like everyone else, and that it’s okay to not be perfect or meet every expectation. But then there's that nagging feeling that I'm just trying to convince myself to feel better about not going. I’m just stuck in this cycle, and it feels exhausting to think about breaking free from it."

Those moments just stick with me. \n\nBut I guess there are also times when people have been kind, even if they feel overshadowed. Like, my aunt once told me she admired my determination in getting through rehab, and that felt nice, but it’s like those moments get drowned out by everything else. \n\nI think the way these thoughts influence my feelings is that they just create this loop of shame and anxiety. I keep replaying those past experiences, and it feels impossible to break out of that cycle of feeling like I’m not good enough. \n\nAs for alternative interpretations, I guess I could tell myself that being imperfect is part of being human, and that I’m allowed to take up space just like everyone else. I could remind myself that I’m trying to do better, and maybe that’s worth something. But then I also feel like that’s just me trying to make excuses for myself.
