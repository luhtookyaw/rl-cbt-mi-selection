        "guided_discovery": "2, The therapist attempted to use guided discovery techniques by asking questions to help the client explore their thoughts and feelings. However, the client repeatedly expressed a desire to avoid the topic, and the therapist did not effectively facilitate self-reflection or insight. The therapist's approach was supportive, but they relied too heavily on persuasion to keep the client engaged in the discussion, which did not lead to significant new perspectives or conclusions for the client.",
        "focus": "2, The therapist attempted to elicit specific thoughts and behaviors related to the client's stress and feelings of defeat, such as the thought process following the missed alarm. However, the therapist struggled to find a focus and repeatedly returned to the same line of questioning, which the client resisted. The focus on cognitions and behaviors was not effectively aligned with the client's key problems, as the client expressed a desire to move away from the topic, indicating a lack of progress in addressing the core issues.",
        "strategy": "2, The therapist attempted to use cognitive-behavioral techniques by exploring the client's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to stress and setbacks. However, the overall strategy for promoting change was vague and did not seem promising in helping the client, as the client repeatedly expressed a desire to avoid the topic and shift to lighter subjects. The therapist did not effectively address the client's resistance or provide a clear, actionable plan for change.",
        "understanding": "4, The therapist generally seemed to grasp the client's internal reality by acknowledging the client's feelings of frustration, defeat, and exhaustion. The therapist reflected on the client's explicit statements and subtly communicated emotions, such as feeling stuck and overwhelmed. However, there were moments where the therapist's responses did not fully address the client's repeated requests to shift the conversation to a lighter topic, indicating a slight deficiency in responding to the client's more subtle communication. This suggests a good ability to listen and empathize, but not an excellent one.",
        "interpersonal": "4, The therapist displayed a satisfactory degree of warmth, concern, confidence, genuineness, and professionalism. However, there were moments where the therapist's attempts to redirect the conversation back to the client's issues might have been perceived as not fully respecting the client's desire to shift to lighter topics. This could have slightly impacted the therapeutic relationship, preventing a score of 6.",
        "collaboration": "2, The therapist attempted to collaborate with the client by exploring the client's feelings and thoughts about their struggles and suggesting small steps for change. However, the therapist struggled to define a problem that the client considered important, as the client repeatedly expressed a desire to shift the conversation to a lighter topic. The therapist did not fully establish a collaborative goal-setting process or decision-making that the client was engaged in, as the client consistently resisted diving into the issues discussed."
