  "conversation": "Therapist: Hi Blaise, it’s good to see you today. What’s been on your mind that brought you in to talk with me?\nClient: I don't know, I guess I've just been thinking about the wedding list and how my parents reacted to it. It's frustrating, you know? They have these ideas about who should be invited, and it's like they don't even consider what I want. I feel like I'm stuck between wanting to please them and trying to stand my ground. It’s just... overwhelming. I'm not even sure if this is the right place to talk about it. I mean, do you really get how complicated family stuff can be?\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Blaise. Can you tell me more about your feelings regarding the wedding list? What specific aspects of your parents' reactions have been the most frustrating for you? I'm curious to hear about your own desires for the guest list and how you envision it. How do you feel about trying to balance your needs with what your parents expect? Lastly, what do you hope to achieve in this conversation today?\nClient: I mean, it’s just... it feels like they’re making all these decisions without really listening to me. Like, I understand they want to be involved, but it’s my wedding, right? I want it to be special for me and my partner, not just a list that satisfies their expectations. I guess I just want them to recognize what I want, but every time I try to bring it up, it feels like I’m walking on eggshells. \n\nI just... I don’t know how to balance what I want with what they want. I feel like if I push back too hard, they’ll get upset, and then it’ll turn into this whole big thing. I don’t want that. I just want some understanding, some support. But it’s like I’m trapped in this cycle where I have to keep compromising, and it’s exhausting. I guess I just hope to figure out how to navigate this without feeling so anxious all the time. But, I don’t know if that’s even possible.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're really feeling the weight of your parents' expectations, and that frustration is understandably overwhelming. Wanting to please them while also asserting your own desires can create a tough situation, especially when it feels like you're compromising more than you'd like. It’s clear that you’re hoping for some understanding and support as you navigate these family dynamics, which can be incredibly challenging. After sharing all of this, how do you feel? Do you feel heard in expressing these emotions?\nClient: I mean, it’s nice to hear that you understand where I’m coming from, but I still feel like you don’t really get the full picture, you know? It's not just about the wedding list—it's this whole pattern with my family. I feel like I'm always trying to make everyone happy, but I end up feeling more anxious and frustrated. \n\nSometimes it just feels like no matter what I do, it’s never enough, and that’s exhausting. I guess I just want to feel like my voice matters, but when I try to express how I feel, it turns into this whole thing where I have to justify myself. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of feeling powerless. So, I don't know if I really feel heard. I appreciate you trying to understand, but it’s hard to shake off this feeling of being trapped.\nTherapist: I can sense the deep frustration and anxiety you're experiencing with your family dynamics, especially when it comes to feeling unheard and trapped in a cycle of compromise. It’s completely valid to want your voice to be acknowledged in these discussions, particularly regarding something as significant as your wedding. The exhaustion from trying to please everyone while feeling like it's never enough must be incredibly draining. I’d like to hear more about your experiences with these family patterns and how they impact your feelings during this wedding planning process.\nClient: I get that you want to understand, but it's hard to explain everything. It's like my family has this unwritten rule where I have to keep everyone happy, or else there are consequences. It’s not just the wedding; it’s everything. Every time I try to voice my opinions, it feels like I'm met with resistance, like they don’t really care what I want. \n\nWith the wedding list, when I mention wanting certain people there, it's like they twist it into something else. They’ll say things like, “Why would you invite them?” or “You know how your aunt can be.” And then I just... I feel this pressure to back down and go along with their suggestions. I don’t want them to be upset, but I also feel like I’m losing a part of myself in all of this. It makes me anxious, thinking that if I stand up for myself, they might pull away, and the thought of that is terrifying. \n\nSo, yeah, it feels like I’m stuck in this cycle where no matter how hard I try, I'm left feeling powerless and frustrated. It's just really exhausting to navigate all of this, and I’m not sure how to break free from it.\nTherapist: Can you recall a specific moment when you felt pressured by your parents regarding the wedding list? What was happening at that time? I'd like you to articulate the exact thought that came to your mind in that moment. Once you have that thought, let’s work on capturing it as a clear, concise statement. After that, we can explore how this thought makes you feel and what behaviors it leads to. Finally, I’d like you to reflect on whether this thought is always true or if there are any exceptions.\nClient: I mean, I can think of a few moments, but there’s one that really sticks out. We were sitting at the dinner table, and I casually brought up wanting to invite a couple of friends who mean a lot to me. My dad immediately shot it down, saying something like, “You know how your mother feels about them.” It just felt like a wall came up. \n\nIn that moment, I thought, “If I push this, they’ll just get upset and I’ll ruin the dinner.” So I ended up just agreeing with whatever they wanted, even though it felt wrong. It’s like I can hear this voice in my head saying that I should just go along with them to keep the peace. \n\nAnd honestly, that thought makes me feel trapped and anxious. It’s like I’m stuck in this loop where I can’t break free without causing chaos. I just feel... powerless. I don’t know if that thought is always true, but it sure feels that way more often than not. Sometimes I wonder if there’s a way to voice what I want without it turning into a fight. But it’s hard to imagine that it could be different.\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that specific moment, Blaise. It sounds like the thought you had—“If I push this, they’ll just get upset and I’ll ruin the dinner”—captures a lot of what you're feeling in those situations. Can we explore what evidence you see that supports this thought? What experiences or patterns in your family dynamics reinforce this belief for you? After that, let’s also consider if there’s any evidence that contradicts this thought. How does this thought influence your feelings and behaviors when you’re interacting with your parents? Finally, I’d like you to think about whether there are alternative perspectives or outcomes that might arise if you were to voice your desires more openly.\nClient: I mean, it’s hard to pinpoint evidence that supports that thought without getting into the same old patterns. Like, every time I try to stand my ground, it feels like it ends in a fight or someone getting upset. Just last week, I tried to mention a different venue for the wedding, and it ended with my mom crying. I can’t help but think that if I push too hard on anything, it’s just going to blow up. \n\nBut then, I guess I also have moments where things don’t escalate. Like, sometimes when I’m really calm and just state my opinion, they might listen. But it doesn’t happen often, and even those rare times feel like exceptions rather than the rule. It’s like that voice in my head is always prepared for the worst-case scenario. \n\nThis thought makes me anxious and keeps me from saying what I really want. I just end up agreeing with them to avoid the confrontation. I wish I could envision a situation where I could express my desires without it turning into a fight, but it feels so ingrained in our family dynamics that it’s hard to see it any other way. I just feel so trapped in this cycle.\nTherapist: Let’s take a moment to reflect on the thought, “If I push this, they’ll just get upset and I’ll ruin the dinner.” You mentioned that it feels supported by your experiences, especially when past attempts to assert yourself have led to conflict, like with the venue discussion. Can you think of any specific instances where your opinions were received positively, even if they are rare? How do you think this thought impacts your emotions and actions during family interactions? Finally, what might be some alternative outcomes if you were to express your desires more openly? Let’s summarize these insights and consider how you might apply them moving forward.\nClient: I guess when I think about it, there have been a couple of times where my parents listened without it turning into a huge deal. Like, I mentioned wanting a smaller wedding, and they didn’t react negatively to that. They actually seemed to consider it for a moment. But those moments feel so few and far between, like I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop. \n\nThis thought really weighs on me, though. It makes me anxious, and that anxiety just pushes me to keep my mouth shut. I feel like I can’t be honest without risking everything, and I don’t want to make waves. It’s like I’m constantly trying to navigate this minefield, and I end up just going with the flow to keep the peace. \n\nImagining a different outcome where I could voice my desires more openly feels almost impossible. Like, what if I did speak up and they actually listened? But then I think about all the times they’ve reacted poorly, and it just makes me doubt that would ever happen. I find myself wishing that we could have a conversation where everyone’s feelings are considered, but I don’t know how to get there. \n\nIt feels like I’m stuck in this cycle, you know? I really want to break free from it, but it’s hard to see a clear path forward.\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing those reflections, Blaise. It sounds like there have been moments when your parents have listened to your opinions, which is a positive sign, even if they feel infrequent. Can you take a moment to reflect on how those instances felt compared to the more challenging experiences? What emotions did you experience during those positive interactions? Additionally, let's explore what factors might have contributed to those moments of openness. Finally, I’d like you to consider any evidence that contradicts the belief that asserting yourself will always lead to conflict. How might this exploration influence your approach in future conversations with your parents?\nClient: I mean, those positive moments definitely felt different. When my parents listened, it was like this weight lifted, even if it was just for a brief moment. I felt a little hopeful, like maybe they could understand me. It was nice to feel valued, even if it didn’t last long. But those times are overshadowed by all the times I felt dismissed or met with resistance.\n\nI think the openness in those moments came from me just being calm and not coming in too strongly. I wasn’t pushing too hard, and maybe they sensed that. But, honestly, it’s hard to replicate that feeling. I get so anxious thinking about how they might react, and it makes me want to retreat rather than speak up. I guess the evidence against my belief is there, but it feels like a gamble every time I want to express myself.\n\nIf I could somehow channel that calmness more often, maybe I could have more of those positive interactions. But it’s like I can’t shake off the fear of conflict. I want to break free from this cycle, but I don’t know how. Sometimes I just wish things could change without me having to push so hard. It feels like a lot to navigate, and I'm not sure where to start.\nTherapist: It’s encouraging to hear that there have been moments when you felt valued and hopeful during those positive interactions with your parents. Reflecting on the emotions you experienced during those times can be powerful. Can you identify what specific feelings arose when they listened to you? Additionally, let’s explore the factors that contributed to those moments of openness—what do you think allowed for that calmness and receptiveness? As we consider the evidence that challenges your belief about conflict arising from assertiveness, how might this understanding influence your approach in future conversations with your parents?\nClient: I guess when they listened to me, I felt a mix of relief and maybe a little bit of joy. It was like, for a moment, I could see a possibility for connection, and that felt really good. I just wish it could happen more often, but then I remember how quickly things can flip back to tension and frustration.\n\nI think what contributed to those moments was my own mindset. I was calm, and I didn’t approach the conversation with too much pressure or urgency. I wasn’t trying to force my opinion; I just stated it plainly, and maybe they picked up on that. It’s just hard to recreate that calmness when I feel this overwhelming pressure to keep the peace. \n\nThinking about it, I know there are times when I’ve expressed myself without it escalating. I guess it’s just that fear of conflict that looms over me, making me doubt whether I can speak up without triggering a negative reaction. If I could channel that calmness more often, I think there’s a chance things could feel different, but it’s like I’m stuck in this cycle of anxiety. I just want to find a way to navigate these conversations without feeling so much pressure. I don’t know where to start, honestly. I feel like there’s a lot to untangle.\nTherapist: It sounds like those moments of relief and joy when your parents listened to you are significant, even if they feel fleeting. Recognizing that your calm approach contributed to those positive interactions is an important insight. Can you articulate the negative thought that arises when you consider asserting yourself in future conversations? What emotions come up for you when you think about voicing your desires? After identifying that thought and its associated feelings, let’s explore some alternative, more balanced thoughts that acknowledge your need for connection while also valuing your own needs. Finally, we can discuss how these new thoughts might influence your feelings and behaviors in future interactions with your parents.\nClient: I guess the negative thought that pops up when I think about asserting myself is something like, “If I speak up, it’s going to lead to conflict, and I’ll end up feeling worse.” When I think about voicing my desires, I feel this rush of anxiety and fear, like my stomach drops. It’s overwhelming, and I start to doubt whether it’s even worth it.\n\nBut maybe, if I could find a way to balance that thought with something more realistic, like, “Sometimes my parents can listen, and I deserve to express my needs too,” it might help. I mean, acknowledging that I have a right to my feelings while also hoping for a positive response could open up some possibilities.\n\nIf I can remind myself that not every conversation has to end in conflict, maybe I could feel a little less anxious about speaking up. I just... I want to navigate these discussions without feeling like I’m walking a tightrope all the time. But it’s so deeply ingrained in me to think the worst will happen, and that makes it hard to envision a different outcome. I really want to find a way to break this cycle, but I feel like there’s so much to untangle, and I’m not sure where to start.\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that negative thought, Blaise. It really captures the fear and anxiety you feel when considering asserting yourself. The thought, “If I speak up, it’s going to lead to conflict, and I’ll end up feeling worse,” understandably creates a lot of pressure. Now, let’s explore the emotions tied to that thought—what do you feel in your body when that thought arises? \n\nAlso, the alternative thought you mentioned, “Sometimes my parents can listen, and I deserve to express my needs too,” offers a more balanced perspective. How might embracing this new thought change how you feel about future conversations? Finally, let’s summarize these insights and discuss how recognizing both thoughts can help you approach discussions with your parents in a way that feels less daunting.\nClient: I feel this tightness in my chest when that negative thought comes up, like I’m bracing for impact or something bad to happen. It’s almost like my body is preparing for a fight or flight response. And then there's this lingering dread that just makes it hard to breathe. \n\nBut when I think about that alternative thought—“Sometimes my parents can listen, and I deserve to express my needs too”—it feels different. It gives me a little bit of hope, like maybe I could approach a conversation without that overwhelming pressure. I guess it’s a reminder that there are times they’ve actually listened, and I have a right to my own feelings. \n\nIf I can embrace that new thought, maybe I wouldn't feel so anxious about speaking up next time. It could help me feel a bit more confident going into those discussions. But then, I still find myself worrying about slipping back into that old mindset, and I’m not sure how to keep that balance. I want to break free from this cycle, but it feels really daunting. I guess recognizing both thoughts is a step, but figuring out how to apply it in the moment is where I get stuck. I just wish it didn’t feel so complicated.\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing those feelings, Blaise. It sounds like the tightness in your chest and the sense of dread really highlight the anxiety that arises with that negative thought. Recognizing the alternative thought brings a sense of hope, which is a positive shift. Can we summarize these insights? You’ve identified the negative thought and the physical sensations it brings, along with a more balanced thought that acknowledges your right to express your needs. Let’s brainstorm some practical ways you can remind yourself of this new perspective in real-life situations with your parents. How might you incorporate this understanding into your conversations moving forward?\nClient: I guess summarizing it like that makes it feel a bit clearer. The negative thought really weighs me down, and I can see how it brings on that tightness and dread. But then thinking about the alternative thought—knowing I have a right to my feelings—does give me a bit of hope. \n\nAs for practical ways to remind myself of this new perspective, maybe I could write down that alternative thought and keep it somewhere visible, like on my phone or in my planner. That way, I can see it before I have those conversations with my parents. I could also practice what I want to say in advance, just to help me feel a bit more prepared and less anxious. \n\nIt might help to set small goals, like starting with just one opinion I want to voice and see how that goes, rather than trying to tackle everything at once. I guess I could also remind myself that it’s okay if they don’t react perfectly every time. It’s just hard to shake off that fear of conflict. I want to break this cycle, but it feels like every time I try, I just get caught up in that old mindset again. I guess I just need to find a way to keep the new perspective in mind, even when it gets tough.\nTherapist: It’s great to hear you articulate those practical strategies, Blaise. Writing down your alternative thought and keeping it visible is a solid way to remind yourself of your right to express your feelings. Practicing what you want to say in advance can also help build your confidence and reduce anxiety. Starting with small goals is a wise approach, allowing you to gradually assert yourself without feeling overwhelmed. \n\nAs you prepare for your conversations, consider setting reminders for yourself about the possibility of positive outcomes, even if they feel distant right now. How do you feel about these steps? What might be a manageable next step you could take in your upcoming conversation with your parents?\nClient: I feel a little more hopeful thinking about those steps. Writing down that thought and practicing what I want to say feels like it could really help me prepare. I like the idea of starting small, too, maybe just voicing one opinion about the wedding or something else that isn't as loaded. \n\nFor my next conversation with my parents, I think I could try bringing up the guest list again but frame it in a way that emphasizes how much it means to me to have the people I want there. I could say something like, “I really want to invite these friends because they mean a lot to me,” and see how they respond. Even if it doesn’t go perfectly, I’ll remind myself that it’s okay to express my needs, and that doesn’t mean I’ll ruin everything. \n\nIt still feels daunting, but I guess having a plan makes it feel a bit more manageable. I just have to keep reminding myself that I deserve to be heard, even if it feels risky. I really want to break this cycle, but I know it’ll take time. I just hope I can keep this new perspective in mind when the moment comes.\nTherapist: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling more hopeful about these steps, Blaise. Framing your thoughts around the guest list in a way that emphasizes your feelings is a powerful approach. By expressing how much it means to you to have certain friends there, you’re asserting your needs while also inviting understanding from your parents. \n\nAs you prepare for this conversation, remember to take a moment to breathe and ground yourself before you speak. It’s completely natural to feel a bit daunted, but acknowledging that you deserve to be heard is a significant shift. After the conversation, I encourage you to reflect on how you felt and what you experienced, regardless of the outcome. This reflection can reinforce your progress and help you navigate future discussions. What do you think about setting a small goal for yourself to check in with your feelings afterward?\nClient: I think setting a goal to check in with my feelings afterward is a good idea. It might help me process everything, regardless of how the conversation goes. I could take a few minutes to jot down how I felt during the discussion and any thoughts that came up afterward. I know reflecting on it could help me see what worked and what didn't, which might make it easier next time. \n\nI just hope I can stay grounded and not let the anxiety take over. But having a plan in place feels like a step in the right direction. I really want to break this cycle, and I guess checking in with myself could be part of that process. I’m just trying to remind myself that it’s okay if things don’t go perfectly, and that expressing my needs is important too.\nTherapist: It’s encouraging to hear that you’re open to checking in with your feelings after the conversation. Taking time to reflect on your emotions and thoughts can provide valuable insights and help you recognize your progress, regardless of the outcome. It sounds like you’re developing a solid plan to navigate this situation, which is a positive step forward. \n\nAs you prepare for your conversation, remember that it’s okay to feel anxious; acknowledging that feeling is part of the process. You’ve already shown a lot of growth by recognizing the importance of expressing your needs. How do you feel about the idea of writing down your reflections after the conversation to reinforce your learning and progress?\nClient: I think writing down my reflections afterward is a great idea. It’ll give me a chance to process everything and see how I handled the situation, which might help me understand what worked and what didn’t. I feel like if I can capture those thoughts, it could remind me of the progress I’ve made, even if it feels small. \n\nI just hope I can stay calm enough during the conversation to express myself. The anxiety is still there, but having a plan and knowing that I can reflect on it afterward makes it feel a bit more manageable. I really want to break free from this cycle of feeling powerless, and I guess this is a step in the right direction. It’s just going to take some practice, but I’m willing to try.\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling positive about writing down your reflections afterward. It sounds like capturing those thoughts will help you process the conversation and recognize your growth, which is important. Staying calm during the discussion can be challenging, but having a plan in place gives you a solid foundation to build on. \n\nAs you prepare, consider reminding yourself that it’s okay to feel anxious, and that expressing your needs is a valuable part of the process. Each step you take, no matter how small, contributes to breaking that cycle of feeling powerless. What do you think would be a helpful way to remind yourself of your progress and the importance of your voice as you move forward?\nClient: I think a helpful way to remind myself of my progress would be to create a little affirmation or mantra that I can repeat to myself before the conversation. Something like, “My voice matters, and I have the right to express my needs.” I could write that down and keep it somewhere visible, like on my phone or in my planner, so I see it leading up to the conversation. \n\nAdditionally, I could keep a small journal where I jot down any positive interactions or moments when I felt heard, no matter how minor. That way, I can look back on it when I start to doubt myself or feel overwhelmed. It could serve as a reminder that there are times when things went well, and that I can build on those experiences. \n\nI just need to keep reinforcing that it’s okay to express what I want, and that it doesn’t mean I’m going to ruin everything. It feels like a lot, but having these reminders might help me navigate this process better. I really want to see some change, and I think these little steps could make a difference.\nTherapist: I love the idea of creating an affirmation to remind yourself that your voice matters and that you have the right to express your needs. Keeping it visible on your phone or planner can serve as a powerful prompt before your conversations. Additionally, maintaining a journal to document positive interactions and moments when you felt heard is a fantastic way to reinforce your progress and build confidence. \n\nAs you move forward, these reminders can help counteract any doubts that arise and remind you of the times when things went well. It’s clear that you’re committed to seeing change, and taking these small steps can make a significant difference in how you navigate these conversations. How do you feel about implementing these strategies as you prepare for your upcoming discussions?\nClient: I feel really good about implementing these strategies. Having that affirmation and keeping it visible will remind me of my worth and the importance of my voice, which is something I really need right now. I think the journal will also be helpful, especially on those days when I doubt myself or feel overwhelmed. \n\nKnowing that I have these tools in place makes me feel more prepared for the upcoming conversations. It’s like I’m giving myself permission to express my needs without the constant fear of conflict hanging over me. I just hope I can stay grounded and remember to lean on these reminders when the anxiety kicks in. I really want to break free from feeling trapped in this cycle, and I think these little steps could be what I need to start making that change. It feels like I’m finally taking some control over these situations, and that’s a relief.",
