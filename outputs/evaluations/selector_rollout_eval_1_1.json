  "conversation": "Therapist: Hi Alex, it’s good to see you today. What’s been on your mind that brings you here?\nClient: Yeah, hi. Thanks for seeing me. I guess... I’ve been thinking about my cousin’s wedding. He invited me, but I, well, I haven’t really responded. It’s just... I don’t know. It feels like a lot. I keep imagining how it’s going to be, and it’s just... overwhelming, I guess. I mean, being around family, it’s not exactly my favorite thing.\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Alex. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming about the wedding? Also, how do you generally feel about attending family events? It sounds like there might be some fears or concerns you have about this particular occasion. What do you think attending the wedding might mean for you personally? Finally, let’s think about what you might need to feel more comfortable in responding to the invitation.\nClient: I mean, it's just... family events are always kind of tense for me. I can’t help but think about all the questions they’ll ask. Like, “What am I doing with my life?” or “Why haven’t I lost weight?” I just know they’ll be judging me, especially my mom. It’s like I can hear her voice in my head, saying all those critical things she always does. And honestly, it feels like they don't really want me there anyway. Like I’m just a burden, you know? \n\nThe whole idea just makes me anxious and... sad, I guess. I’d rather just avoid it entirely. But then, I feel guilty for not going because it’s family and I should want to be there, right? I don’t know. It’s just a lot to think about, and I’m not sure what I need to feel comfortable. It’s kind of hard to figure that out when I’m feeling like this.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're really grappling with a mix of anxiety and sadness about the wedding. The pressure of family expectations and the judgments you anticipate can feel incredibly heavy, especially with your mother's critical voice echoing in your mind. It’s understandable to feel like a burden when you’re facing those feelings, and it’s tough to navigate the conflict between wanting to avoid the event and the guilt that comes with not attending. How do these feelings influence how you see yourself and your relationships with your family?\nClient: I guess it just makes me feel even more trapped, you know? Like I can’t escape this cycle of feeling unlovable and unwanted. It’s hard to see myself positively when I’m constantly reminded of what I’m not, especially by my family. I mean, I want to feel like I belong, but every time I go to these events, it just reinforces that I don’t fit in. \n\nSometimes I wonder if my family even really cares about me or if they just see me as the “problem child” or whatever. And then there’s my mom, who I can’t shake off. I feel like she’s the one who’s always made me feel like I’m not good enough, and it just makes me doubt if anyone would really want me there, you know? I don’t know how to handle that when I think about going to the wedding. It feels like... no matter what I do, I can't change how they see me.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're feeling really trapped in this cycle of believing that you’re unlovable and unwanted, especially in the context of your family. The weight of their expectations and judgments seems to have a significant impact on how you see yourself, and it’s completely valid to feel like a burden when those feelings are so intense. It’s okay to feel conflicted about attending the wedding, given all these emotions and the history with your mom. I’d like to hear more about how you’re feeling about this situation, without any pressure to find a solution just yet.\nClient: I appreciate you saying that. Honestly, it’s just hard to separate my feelings from the reality of the situation. I feel like I’m constantly battling these thoughts—like if I go, I’m walking into a room full of judgment and expectations. I mean, I know I shouldn’t care what they think, but it’s my family, you know? It’s like they have this power over me, and I can’t shake it off. \n\nWhen I think about the wedding, I just feel this heaviness in my chest. I don’t want to be the center of attention, and I dread those questions that make me feel like I’m under a microscope. I guess it just makes me sad thinking that I’ll never be who they want me to be, and it’s frustrating that I can’t just be myself without feeling that pressure. \n\nSometimes I wish I could just disappear for a bit instead of facing all that. But then, I think about how it would feel to have that connection with family, and it makes me feel guilty for wanting to avoid it. So, I’m stuck in this weird place where I don’t know what’s right.\nTherapist: I can sense how heavy this feels for you, Alex. Let’s take a moment to focus on a specific instance when you felt judged by your family. Can you recall a particular moment that stands out to you? What exact thought came to mind during that experience? Try to frame that thought clearly, like saying, “I am unlovable.” I want to acknowledge how that thought impacts your feelings about attending the wedding. How do you think this thought influences your decisions regarding family events, like your cousin's wedding?\nClient: I mean, there have been so many moments, it’s hard to pick just one. But I can remember a family gathering a couple of years ago. It was one of those times when everyone was chatting and laughing, and I felt completely on the outside. I remember my mom made a comment about my weight in front of everyone, something like, “If you just tried a little harder, you’d be better off.” \n\nIn that moment, I felt like the air was sucked out of the room. I thought to myself, “I am unlovable.” It just hit me hard, and I felt so embarrassed and ashamed. All I wanted to do was disappear. It’s like that thought just spirals from there, you know? It makes me think that if I can’t even be accepted by my own family, what hope do I have anywhere else? \n\nSo, when it comes to events like this wedding, I just freeze up. I feel like I have to prepare for that kind of judgment, and it’s exhausting. I know I shouldn’t let it affect me so much, but it feels impossible to escape that feeling of being unwanted. It’s like I’m stuck between wanting to be part of the family and fearing their rejection at the same time.\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that experience, Alex. It sounds like that moment with your mom really solidified the thought that \"I am unlovable\" for you. Can you think of any evidence that supports this thought? What about evidence that might contradict it? I’m curious to explore how this belief has shaped your feelings and behaviors, especially in family situations. How do you think this thought influences your emotions when you consider attending the wedding? Lastly, what alternative explanations might there be for your experiences at family events?\nClient: I guess when I think about it, there’s definitely evidence that seems to support that thought. Like, my mom’s comments stick with me, and they just reinforce that feeling of not being good enough. It’s hard to shake off those moments when I feel judged, especially in front of everyone. It’s like, how can I possibly believe I’m lovable when that’s the message I keep getting?\n\nBut then, there’s also a part of me that knows it’s not completely true. I mean, I have friends who care about me, and I know they see me differently. They don’t judge me the way my family does. Sometimes I think maybe my family is just... complicated, and their judgments come from their own issues, not necessarily about me. But when I’m in those family situations, it’s like I can’t remember those other perspectives. All I see is the rejection and criticism.\n\nConsidering attending the wedding, those thoughts just amplify my anxiety. I can’t help but anticipate that same judgment from my family, and it just makes me feel like I’m walking into a trap. It’s frustrating because I want to feel connected and accepted, but that fear of being unwanted looms so large. I just end up feeling stuck, like I’m in this loop of wanting to belong but being terrified of the rejection that seems inevitable. It’s exhausting to think about it all.\nTherapist: It’s clear that you’re navigating a lot of conflicting emotions around this, Alex. You’ve identified some strong evidence that seems to support the thought of being unlovable, especially with your mom's comments weighing heavily on you. Yet, you’ve also pointed out that you have friends who care for you and see you differently, which contradicts that belief. \n\nHow do you think recognizing that your family’s judgments may stem from their own issues could shift your perspective on attending the wedding? If you were to consider this alternative explanation, how might it influence your feelings about being there and your decision to respond to the invitation?\nClient: I mean, I guess it could help a little if I think about it that way. If I remind myself that their judgments might come from their own stuff, it might lessen the weight of it all. Like, maybe it’s not really about me being unlovable, but more about them being critical for their own reasons. It’s just hard to remember that in the moment, you know? \n\nWhen I’m actually there, it’s like those thoughts take over, and I forget that I have friends who see me differently. I guess if I could focus on that perspective, it might make the idea of going to the wedding a bit easier to handle. But still, I keep thinking about how uncomfortable it’ll be and how I’ll probably end up feeling judged. \n\nI mean, I want to be there for my cousin, but that fear of rejection is so strong. It’s like I’m stuck between wanting to belong and fearing that I’ll just be reminded of why I feel unwanted in the first place. It’s frustrating to think that I could feel connected one moment but then just slip right back into that sadness the next. I suppose if I could just keep reminding myself that their views aren’t the whole truth, it might help… but I don’t know if I’m strong enough to do that in the moment.\nTherapist: It’s really insightful that you’re recognizing how your family’s judgments might originate from their own struggles rather than being a reflection of your worth. That shift in perspective could indeed provide some relief when you think about attending the wedding. Let’s take a moment to explore how this understanding could impact your feelings. \n\nWhat would it look like for you to hold onto that thought—that their views aren’t the complete truth—when you’re at the wedding? How might that empower you to engage differently with your family? And as you consider this, what feelings arise about your decision to attend or not attend the wedding?\nClient: I mean, it’s definitely a different way to look at it. If I could really hold onto that thought, I think it might help me feel a bit more grounded. Maybe I could remind myself that their judgments don’t define who I am, and that could give me a little more confidence to engage with my family. I could try to focus on the good moments, like connecting with my cousin or even just enjoying the celebration. \n\nBut honestly, I still feel that heaviness in my chest. It’s like I want to believe that I can handle it, but I’m still scared of how I'll feel when I’m actually there. I can picture myself getting caught up in my head again, feeling judged and unwanted, and it just makes me want to retreat. \n\nThinking about attending is definitely stressful, especially when I know I could just avoid it altogether. But then there's that part of me that feels guilty for not being there for my cousin. I guess I’m just torn between wanting to be part of the family and fearing that I’ll be reminded of all the reasons I feel out of place. It’s just frustrating to think about all of this, you know? I wish it didn’t feel so complicated.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're feeling quite torn between wanting to be there for your cousin and the fear of being reminded of those painful feelings around judgment and rejection. It’s understandable to feel that heaviness in your chest as you navigate these conflicting emotions. Let’s focus on that thought you mentioned—reminding yourself that their judgments don’t define you. How might you bring that thought into the wedding setting? Can you think of specific moments during the event where you could consciously remind yourself of this perspective? What might that look like for you, and how could it help you feel more connected and less anxious?\nClient: I guess if I were to bring that thought into the wedding, I could try to prepare myself beforehand. Like, maybe I could have a little mantra or something to remind me, like, “Their opinions don’t define me.” I could practice saying that to myself before I even get there, so it’s kind of like a shield against all those judgments I’m anticipating. \n\nDuring the event, if I feel those familiar anxious thoughts creeping in, I could try to take a moment to breathe and remind myself of that perspective. Like, when someone asks me a question that makes me uncomfortable, instead of spiraling into that feeling of being unwanted, I could focus on responding in a way that reflects who I really am, rather than how they see me. \n\nI could also look for those moments where I feel connected—like when I’m chatting with my cousin or enjoying the celebration. If I can focus on those positive interactions and remind myself that they’re what really matter, it might help me feel less overwhelmed. \n\nBut still, I can’t shake that fear. I know I’m capable of thinking this way, but when I’m in the moment, it’s like the weight of their judgments just pulls me down. I guess I just need to find those small ways to remind myself that I deserve to feel connected, regardless of their opinions. It’s just... easier said than done, you know?\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing those thoughts, Alex. It sounds like you have a solid plan for how to prepare yourself mentally before the wedding, like using a mantra to remind yourself that their opinions don’t define you. That’s a great step. \n\nLet’s think about a safe space or person you can connect with during the wedding if you start to feel anxious. Is there someone there you trust who could help ground you in those moments? Also, how might you remind yourself of your worth when faced with uncomfortable questions? It could be helpful to outline a plan for that. \n\nLastly, setting a time limit for how long you’ll stay at the wedding might ease some of that pressure. How do you feel about that idea? And as you consider all of this, what positive interactions do you hope to have at the wedding that you can focus on?\nClient: Yeah, I think having a safe space or someone to connect with would really help. My cousin is pretty supportive, so maybe I could stick close to him during the wedding. If I start feeling overwhelmed, I could just take a moment to step aside and breathe. That might help me reset a bit.\n\nAs for handling uncomfortable questions, I guess I could prepare a few simple responses in advance. Like, if someone asks about my job or weight, I could say something like, “I’m working on things at my own pace.” It’s not too revealing, but it shows I’m moving forward without getting into the nitty-gritty. \n\nSetting a time limit sounds good too. Just knowing I have an out could help take some pressure off. Maybe I could plan to stay for an hour or two, enjoy the highlights, and then leave. That way, I could focus on the positive interactions—like catching up with my cousin or sharing some laughs with family. \n\nI just hope I can keep that mindset when I’m there. It’s a lot to juggle, and while I want to be part of the celebration, I’m still worried about slipping back into those old feelings of being unwanted. But I guess if I can hold onto my worth and focus on the connections, it could make the experience a bit more bearable.\nTherapist: It sounds like you’re starting to build a practical plan for the wedding, Alex, which is great to hear. Having your cousin as a supportive presence could really help you feel more grounded, and it’s wise to prepare those simple responses for any uncomfortable questions. Setting a time limit for yourself is also a smart strategy; it gives you the freedom to leave when you need to while still allowing space for positive interactions. \n\nAs you think about those moments you want to focus on, like connecting with your cousin and enjoying the celebration, how do you envision reminding yourself of your worth during the event? What specific strategies can you implement to keep that perspective at the forefront? Let’s outline a plan for how you’ll carry these thoughts with you into the wedding.\nClient: I think I can try to remind myself of my worth by keeping that mantra in my head, like “Their opinions don’t define me.” Maybe I could even write it down and keep it in my pocket or something, so it’s always there as a little reminder. \n\nIf I start to feel overwhelmed, I could take a moment to breathe and repeat it to myself. I could also visualize those positive interactions I want to have, like laughing with my cousin or enjoying the food. Focusing on those moments might help me stay connected to the experience instead of getting lost in my head.\n\nI guess I could also plan to check in with myself throughout the wedding. Like, take a moment every so often to see how I’m feeling and remind myself of the progress I’ve made. If I notice those negative thoughts creeping in, I can try to counter them with something positive—like remembering the friends I have who care about me or the things I’m proud of in my life.\n\nIt feels a bit daunting to think about all of this, but having a plan might just give me the boost I need to stick with it. I really want to enjoy the day and not let my fears hold me back. I just hope I can stay strong enough to remember all of this when I’m actually there.\nTherapist: It’s encouraging to hear you articulate such a thoughtful plan, Alex. Keeping that mantra close and visualizing those positive interactions can serve as powerful reminders of your worth, especially in moments of anxiety. Checking in with yourself throughout the wedding is also a great strategy; it allows you to stay present and aware of your feelings. \n\nAs you prepare for this event, remember that it’s okay to have moments of doubt, but you’re actively working on ways to counter those thoughts. Embracing the support of your cousin and focusing on the connections you want to nurture can help you feel more grounded. It’s a big step to want to enjoy the day despite your fears, and I believe you have the strength to navigate this. How do you feel about this plan as you think about the wedding approaching?\nClient: I feel a little better thinking about the plan we’ve outlined. It’s nice to have something concrete to hold onto, you know? The idea of keeping that mantra with me and visualizing the positive moments gives me a bit of hope. I mean, I know it’s going to be tough, and I might still feel anxious, but at least I have some strategies to lean on when those feelings hit. \n\nTalking about it all helps me feel a bit more prepared, but there’s still that nagging fear in the back of my mind. I just hope I can stick to this plan when I’m actually there, and not let my worries take over. But I guess if I can remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious and just focus on those small moments of connection, it might make a difference. \n\nOverall, I’m trying to stay positive about it. It feels like a step in the right direction, and even though I’m still feeling that heaviness, having a plan makes it feel a little less overwhelming. I really want to enjoy this day and not let my fears control me.\nTherapist: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling a bit more prepared with the plan we've discussed, Alex. Having those strategies in place can really help you navigate the anxiety while still allowing space for connection and enjoyment. It’s completely normal to have some lingering fears, but it sounds like you’re committed to focusing on those positive moments and reminding yourself of your worth. \n\nAs the wedding approaches, it might be helpful to practice your mantra and visualize those interactions a few times to reinforce that mindset. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious; acknowledging those feelings is part of the process. You’re taking important steps towards enjoying the day, and I believe you have the resilience to handle whatever comes your way. How do you feel about continuing to build on this plan as the wedding gets closer?\nClient: I think that sounds like a good idea. I definitely want to practice the mantra and visualize those positive moments leading up to the wedding. It feels like it could really help me ground myself and remind me of what I want to focus on. I know I’ll probably have moments of anxiety, and that’s okay. Just being aware of that and having these strategies to lean on makes it feel a bit more manageable. \n\nI guess I just have to keep reminding myself that it’s not about being perfect—it's about showing up and trying to connect with my family in whatever way I can. I want to enjoy being there for my cousin, and I think this plan will help me stay on track. It feels good to have a direction, even if I still feel that heaviness sometimes. I appreciate you helping me work through all of this.\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more empowered with the strategies we've discussed, Alex. Practicing your mantra and visualizing those positive moments can really set a strong foundation for how you approach the wedding. You're absolutely right—it's not about being perfect but about showing up and making an effort to connect. \n\nAs you continue to prepare, remember that it's okay to have those moments of heaviness; acknowledging them is part of the journey. You've made significant progress in understanding how to navigate these feelings, and it sounds like you're ready to embrace the experience with an open heart. If you find it helpful, we can also explore any additional support or coping techniques as the wedding date approaches. How do you feel about that?\nClient: I think that could be helpful, actually. If we can explore some additional support or coping techniques, it might give me even more tools to work with as the wedding gets closer. I want to feel as prepared as possible, you know? I just don’t want to feel overwhelmed when the day comes. \n\nI appreciate being able to talk this through with you. It feels good to have a plan, but having a few more strategies might just give me that extra boost I need. I want to make the most of this day and not let my fears hold me back too much. So, yeah, I’m open to discussing more ways to support myself leading up to the wedding.\nTherapist: It’s great to hear that you’re open to exploring additional support and coping techniques, Alex. Let’s think about a small, manageable action you can take before the wedding to reinforce your mantra. What’s one thing you could do in the days leading up to the event that feels achievable? Additionally, I encourage you to practice your mantra daily, especially during moments of anxiety. \n\nIt might also be helpful to create a list of positive interactions you hope to have at the wedding, focusing on the connections you want to nurture. Lastly, let’s outline a specific plan for how you’ll engage with your cousin during the event. This could include a few conversation starters or activities you can do together. How does that sound to you?\nClient: That sounds like a solid plan. For the days leading up to the wedding, I could set aside a few minutes each day to practice my mantra and visualize those positive moments. Maybe even write it down and place it somewhere I’ll see it often, like on my bathroom mirror or in my wallet. That way, it’ll be a constant reminder.\n\nCreating a list of positive interactions I hope to have sounds good too. I think I’ll jot down things like catching up with my cousin and enjoying the food, maybe even sharing some laughs with other family members. Just focusing on those moments can help shift my mindset.\n\nAs for engaging with my cousin, I could think of a few conversation starters. Something simple like asking him how he’s been or what his plans are after the wedding could work. I could also suggest we take a picture together or even share a fun memory from when we were younger. It feels nice to have some concrete ideas for how to connect.\n\nOverall, I think these steps will help me feel more prepared and focused on the positive aspects of the wedding. I really want to make the most of it, so having these strategies in place feels like a step in the right direction. Thank you for helping me work through all of this; it truly means a lot.\nTherapist: I’m glad to hear that you’re feeling more prepared with these actionable steps, Alex. Writing your mantra down and placing it where you’ll see it regularly is a great idea; it can serve as a constant reminder of your worth. Creating that list of positive interactions is also a wonderful way to focus on what you want to experience at the wedding, and I love the conversation starters you’ve thought of for engaging with your cousin. \n\nIt sounds like you’re building a solid foundation to navigate the day, and I appreciate your commitment to making the most of this experience. As the wedding approaches, let’s check in on how these strategies are working for you and adjust as needed. Remember, it’s okay to feel a mix of emotions, and you’re taking important steps toward connection and enjoyment. How do you feel about everything we’ve discussed today?\nClient: I feel really good about everything we’ve discussed today. It’s comforting to have these strategies in place and to know that I can practice my mantra and visualize those positive moments leading up to the wedding. Writing it down and having a list of interactions I want to focus on really helps me feel more in control. \n\nI appreciate your support and guidance through all of this. It’s been helpful to talk about my feelings and fears regarding the wedding, and I feel a bit lighter knowing I have a plan. I know it won’t be perfect, but I feel more equipped to handle whatever comes my way. I’m looking forward to seeing how it all plays out and hoping I can stay connected with my cousin and the family. Thank you for helping me find a way forward.",
