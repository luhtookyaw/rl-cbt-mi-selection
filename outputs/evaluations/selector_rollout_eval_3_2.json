  "conversation": "Therapist: Hi Caleb, it’s great to see you today. What’s been on your mind that has brought you in for a session?\nClient: I guess I've just been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why, but I keep comparing myself to others in my program. I see them working long hours and publishing more papers, and it makes me question whether I’m doing enough. I know I should be focused on my projects, but instead, I find myself just... stuck. I wonder if there’s something wrong with me for not being able to push through like they do. It just feels like, I don’t know, like I’m failing or something.\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Caleb. When you think about comparing yourself to your colleagues, what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you? I'm curious about how these comparisons impact your motivation and your ability to focus on your own projects. Can you recall any moments where you felt proud of your work or successful in your research? It might also be helpful to explore what \"doing enough\" means to you personally and how you define success on your own terms. Lastly, what steps do you think you could take to align more with your own goals rather than the expectations of others?\nClient: I mean, it’s just... I don’t know if I can really pinpoint those moments of pride. It feels like there’s always something I could’ve done better, you know? Like, I keep thinking about how much further along I could be if I just worked harder or found something groundbreaking. It’s like this pressure to measure up, and when I don’t, it just reinforces this belief that I’m not competent. \n\nAs for \"doing enough,\" I guess I’ve always thought it meant being productive, like publishing papers and getting recognition. But when I see others achieving that, I just feel... inadequate. I don’t really know what my own version of success looks like, honestly. It’s hard to even think about that when I’m constantly spiraling into these comparisons.\n\nAnd the steps? I mean, I could try to focus on my own work more, but it’s tough when my mind keeps drifting back to what everyone else is doing. It feels like I’m just stuck in this cycle of ruminating and procrastinating. I don’t know... I guess I just feel overwhelmed thinking about it all.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're really grappling with feelings of inadequacy and the pressure to keep up with your peers. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when you're constantly measuring yourself against others, especially in such a competitive environment. The struggle to define what success means for you personally can be incredibly challenging, particularly when comparisons seem to overshadow your own achievements. I'm curious about how these comparisons affect how you see yourself and your capabilities. In this moment, how do you feel being seen and understood as you share these thoughts?\nClient: I mean, it's nice to feel seen, I guess. But at the same time, I can’t shake this feeling of doubt. It's like, sure, you get it, but what does that really mean for me? I still feel this weight, like I'm carrying around this heavy expectation to be better, to do more. I want to feel proud of what I do, but it’s hard when every little setback just makes me feel like I’m not measuring up. So, while I appreciate you trying to understand, I can’t help but feel that I’m still stuck in this place of not knowing how to get out of it. It’s frustrating, honestly.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're really feeling the weight of those expectations and the frustration that comes with not being able to shake off that doubt. The pressure to constantly do more and be better can be incredibly overwhelming, especially when it feels like every setback reinforces those feelings of inadequacy. It's completely valid to feel stuck in this cycle, and recognizing that is an important step. I’d like to hear more about your thoughts on success and productivity—what do those concepts mean to you beyond the comparisons? It's okay to explore these feelings, and doing so can help clarify what you truly want for yourself.\nClient: I guess when I think about success, it just feels like it's tied to all these external markers, you know? Like getting published, getting noticed by my peers, and just climbing that academic ladder. But honestly, beyond that, it’s tough to imagine what success would look like for me. I mean, maybe it could be about finishing projects or feeling satisfied with my work, but then I doubt if that’s enough. \n\nProductivity feels like this never-ending race where I need to constantly output something, and if I’m not hitting those benchmarks, I just feel like I’m failing. It’s frustrating because I know in theory that success should be about what I value, but when I’m stuck in these comparisons, it clouds everything. I want to feel proud and fulfilled, but it’s hard to see how I can get there when I’m so focused on what everyone else is doing. It feels like I’m just spinning my wheels without making any real progress.\nTherapist: Can you recall a specific moment when you felt that pressure or inadequacy, perhaps while comparing yourself to your peers? What was the exact thought that crossed your mind during that time? It might help to frame that thought clearly, like saying, \"I am not doing enough.\" Once you identify that, let’s explore how that thought makes you feel and how it impacts your behavior. Finally, I’d like you to consider if there are alternative thoughts that could offer a different perspective on your situation.\nClient: I can think of a moment from a few weeks ago during a seminar. I looked around and saw my colleagues presenting their findings, and it just hit me hard. I thought, \"Why am I not as far along as they are?\" It felt like everyone else was moving forward while I was stuck. I remember feeling a wave of shame wash over me, like I was completely inadequate compared to them. \n\nThat thought really spiraled into this overwhelming sense of panic, making me feel anxious and tense. I ended up just zoning out during the rest of the seminar because I couldn't shake that feeling of defeat. It impacts my motivation so much; instead of feeling inspired, I just feel paralyzed and start to procrastinate. \n\nI know I should probably challenge that thought, but it's hard to think of alternatives when I'm so deep in that mindset. I guess part of me believes that if I don’t hit those external markers, I’m just not good enough. It’s frustrating to feel like I can’t break out of that cycle, you know?\nTherapist: Let's take a closer look at that thought: \"Why am I not as far along as they are?\" Can you reflect on any evidence that supports this belief? What makes you feel like you’re not measuring up? Now, let’s also think about any evidence that contradicts this thought or suggests you are making progress in your own way. How does holding onto this belief affect your emotions and behaviors, especially regarding your motivation and productivity? Lastly, can you brainstorm some alternative thoughts that might provide a more balanced perspective on your situation?\nClient: I mean, when I think about it, there are definitely moments when I’ve made progress—like finishing a section of my research or figuring out a tricky part of the analysis. But those moments feel so small compared to what others are doing. It’s hard to find anything that feels substantial enough to counter that thought. \n\nI guess the evidence supporting the belief is just looking around at my peers and seeing their accomplishments. They seem so much more accomplished, and it’s like all I see are my shortcomings. That really drives home the idea that I’m not measuring up. \n\nHolding onto that belief just makes me feel anxious and overwhelmed, like I’m constantly under this pressure to do more. It leads to me zoning out or procrastinating, which only reinforces that feeling of inadequacy. Like, I know I should be doing more, but then I just freeze up, and it feels like I’m in this constant loop. \n\nAs for alternative thoughts, I honestly struggle to think of any right now. I mean, maybe I could tell myself that everyone has their own pace, or that I’m learning and growing in my own way. But even those thoughts feel a bit weak against the weight of what I’m seeing around me. It’s just frustrating to feel so stuck in this mindset.\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing those reflections, Caleb. It’s clear that you have made some progress, even if it feels small in comparison to what you perceive others are achieving. Let’s take a moment to acknowledge those specific achievements, like finishing a section of your research or overcoming challenges in your analysis. How do you think these accomplishments contribute to your growth and learning as a researcher? \n\nNow, let’s explore what success could look like for you beyond those external markers. Can we think about alternative definitions of success that resonate with your values, such as personal satisfaction or the completion of projects? Finally, I’d like you to consider creating a balanced thought that recognizes both your efforts and the pressures you feel from those comparisons. What might that look like for you?\nClient: I guess when I think about those small achievements, they do matter, but it’s hard to really feel proud of them when I'm constantly looking at what everyone else is doing. I mean, finishing a section of research is great, but it feels like just a drop in the bucket compared to the bigger picture of what I think I should be achieving. It's like, I know I’m making progress, but I don't feel that sense of accomplishment because I'm so focused on the bigger accolades that others are getting.\n\nAs for redefining success, I really want to think about what that could mean for me personally, rather than just what’s expected in academia. Maybe it could be about finding joy in the research process itself or feeling a sense of fulfillment when I complete a project, regardless of whether it gets published or not. It’s tricky, though, because I’ve always been conditioned to think that success is tied to recognition and productivity. \n\nCreating a balanced thought sounds like a good idea, but I’m not sure how to put it into words. Maybe something like, \"I am making progress at my own pace, and that’s okay\"? But even then, I worry it’s not enough to counter that nagging feeling of inadequacy. It’s hard to shake that weight off, you know?\nTherapist: It’s really insightful that you recognize the importance of those small achievements, even if they feel overshadowed by what others are doing. Acknowledging that progress is still progress is a significant step. As you think about redefining success, focusing on joy in the research process and fulfillment from completing projects can be powerful alternatives to the traditional markers of success. \n\nLet’s work on articulating that balanced thought together. How about framing it as, \"I am making meaningful progress in my own way, and it’s okay to celebrate that\"? This acknowledges your journey while also validating your feelings of pressure. How does that resonate with you?\nClient: That balanced thought does feel a bit more affirming, I think. \"I am making meaningful progress in my own way, and it’s okay to celebrate that\"—it’s a nice way to remind myself that my journey isn’t just about external validation. I guess it allows for a little more breathing room, like I can give myself permission to feel good about what I accomplish, even if it feels small compared to others.\n\nBut still, there’s this lingering doubt, you know? I can say that to myself, but when I'm in the thick of it—like during seminars or when I’m working on a tough section—it all seems to fade. I start questioning if I really am making progress or if I'm just fooling myself. It’s frustrating because I want to believe that thought, but it feels like a constant battle against those feelings of inadequacy that creep back in. It’s like I’m trying to find a foothold, but it keeps slipping away.\nTherapist: Let’s take a moment to reflect on those feelings of doubt that arise, especially during challenging situations like seminars or tough sections of your work. Can you identify specific instances when you felt you were making progress, even if they seem small? What thoughts did you have during those moments? Now, let’s also explore any evidence that supports your feelings of inadequacy. What are the thoughts that come up for you that make you question your progress? Finally, I’d like you to consider any evidence that contradicts those feelings, such as achievements or positive feedback you've received. How might weighing both types of evidence help you develop a more balanced perspective on your progress and self-worth?\nClient: I think back to those moments when I’ve made progress, like when I finally figured out a complex part of my analysis or when I finished a draft I was really struggling with. In those times, I felt a little spark of pride, like maybe I was getting somewhere. I remember thinking, \"Okay, I can do this.\" But then, those thoughts get overshadowed pretty quickly by the pressure I feel when I see my peers presenting or publishing. \n\nThe thoughts that come up when I feel inadequate are pretty harsh, honestly. It's like, \"You should be further along,\" or \"Why can’t you just work harder?\" Those thoughts just spiral and make me feel stuck again. I know I’ve achieved things—there's feedback from my advisor that acknowledges my work, and I've had moments where I felt really engaged in my research. But it’s so easy to forget that when I’m focused on what others are doing. \n\nWeighing both types of evidence feels like a tug-of-war. On one hand, I can see the small wins, but then the comparisons pull me back into that dark place where I feel like I’m not enough. It’s exhausting, and I really want to find a way to hold onto those positive moments more firmly, but it’s like they’re fleeting. I guess I’m just trying to figure out how to keep those feelings of inadequacy from overshadowing everything else. It’s frustrating because I want to break that cycle but don’t know how.\nTherapist: It’s great that you can recall those moments of progress, like figuring out a complex analysis or finishing a draft. Those achievements are significant, and it’s important to acknowledge the pride you felt in those instances. The harsh thoughts that come up when you compare yourself to others can be really overwhelming, and it’s understandable that they overshadow your successes. \n\nLet’s explore how you might hold onto those positive feelings more firmly. When you experience a small win, how could you remind yourself of that accomplishment in a way that feels tangible? Perhaps keeping a journal or a list of those achievements could help reinforce that you are making progress. Additionally, when those feelings of inadequacy arise, can you practice pausing to reflect on the evidence of your growth? This could help create a buffer against the comparisons that pull you down. What do you think about these ideas?\nClient: I think keeping a journal or a list of my achievements could be really helpful. It would give me something concrete to look back on when I’m feeling overwhelmed or stuck in that cycle of comparisons. I mean, it sounds simple, but just having those reminders of what I’ve accomplished might help me see that I am making progress, even if it feels small.\n\nAs for pausing to reflect on the evidence of my growth, I can see how that might create a little space between the comparison thoughts and how I feel about myself. It’s just tough to remember to do that in the moment, you know? I guess I could try to make it a habit, maybe even set reminders for myself. But it feels like one more thing on my plate, and I worry about adding to my stress instead of alleviating it.\n\nIt’s frustrating because I want to feel that sense of progress more consistently, but it’s like I’m fighting against this tide of self-doubt. Still, I do see the value in these ideas. Maybe if I can remind myself more often that I have made strides, it might help shift my perspective a bit. It just feels like a lot to navigate, especially when those feelings of inadequacy come rushing back so quickly.\nTherapist: It’s encouraging to hear that you see the potential benefits of keeping a journal or a list of your achievements. Having a tangible reminder of your progress can serve as a powerful tool to combat those feelings of inadequacy. As you think about creating that habit, perhaps you could start small—maybe just a few lines each week reflecting on what you’ve accomplished. \n\nWhen it comes to pausing to reflect on your growth, it might help to set a specific time for this, like at the end of the day or week, rather than trying to remember in the moment. This way, it becomes a part of your routine rather than an added stressor. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, but integrating these practices gradually could help you navigate those feelings of self-doubt more effectively. How does that sound to you?\nClient: I think starting small with the journal makes sense. Just a few lines each week could feel manageable, and it might help me shift my focus when I’m feeling overwhelmed. It’s nice to think about having something concrete to look back on, even if it feels like a small step. \n\nSetting a specific time to reflect on my growth could also create some structure, which might make it easier to remember. I like the idea of doing it at the end of the week; it feels like a good way to wrap things up and acknowledge what I’ve done, rather than just jumping into the next week without any recognition of my progress. \n\nBut, I have to admit, there’s still this nagging feeling in the back of my mind. Even if I try these new habits, I worry that the self-doubt will still creep back in and overshadow everything. It feels like every time I try to push forward, those feelings of inadequacy just pull me back. I want to be able to celebrate my achievements, but it’s hard when it feels like the pressure is always there.\nTherapist: It’s really positive that you’re feeling more open to starting small with the journal and setting aside time for reflection. These practices can create a foundation for recognizing your progress, which is an important step in countering those feelings of self-doubt. \n\nI understand that the nagging feeling of inadequacy can be persistent, and it’s completely valid to worry about it overshadowing your efforts. It might be helpful to remind yourself that it’s okay to experience those feelings; they don’t define your worth or your progress. When they arise, can you practice acknowledging them without judgment, perhaps by saying to yourself, “This is just a feeling, not a fact”? \n\nOver time, as you reinforce your achievements and create space for reflection, you may find that those feelings have less power over you. How do you feel about trying that approach when self-doubt surfaces?\nClient: I think recognizing those feelings without judgment could be a helpful approach. It’s like giving myself permission to feel what I feel without letting it dictate how I see my progress. I can see how saying, “This is just a feeling, not a fact,” might help create that distance, allowing me to acknowledge it without getting swept away by it.\n\nBut I have to admit, it seems easier said than done. I worry that when those feelings of inadequacy hit, it’ll be hard to remember to step back and view them objectively. I guess it’s one of those things that would take practice, and I’m not always great with that. It’s frustrating because I want to believe I can manage those feelings, but it feels like a constant battle.\n\nStill, I’m willing to give it a try. Maybe if I practice acknowledging those feelings while also reinforcing my achievements, it might help me create a more balanced perspective over time. It just feels like a lot to juggle right now, especially when I’m already feeling overwhelmed.\nTherapist: It's encouraging to hear that you're open to the idea of recognizing your feelings without judgment. Acknowledging those feelings as just that—feelings—can indeed create some distance and help you avoid getting swept away by them. It’s understandable to feel that this might be easier said than done, especially when you're in the thick of self-doubt. \n\nPracticing this approach will take time, and it's okay to be gentle with yourself as you navigate it. Perhaps you could remind yourself that it's a process, and every time you catch yourself in that cycle, it’s an opportunity to practice that new perspective. It might also help to pair this practice with your journaling, noting down instances when you successfully recognized those feelings and how you managed them. \n\nHow does that sound to you as a way to integrate these strategies into your routine?\nClient: I think pairing the practice of recognizing my feelings with my journaling could be a really effective way to integrate everything. Noting down those moments when I catch myself in that cycle and how I handle them might help reinforce the new habits I’m trying to build. It gives me a tangible way to reflect on my progress, even in this area. \n\nI can see how it would be helpful to remind myself that it's a process and that setbacks are part of it. That perspective could take some of the pressure off, allowing me to be more forgiving with myself when I struggle. It just feels like a lot to juggle, especially when those feelings of inadequacy can be so consuming. \n\nBut, I’m willing to give it a try. I guess it’s about finding that balance and acknowledging where I am while also celebrating the progress I’ve made, however small it may seem. I just hope I can stick with it and not let the self-doubt derail me too much. It’s frustrating to feel that way, but I do see some value in these strategies.\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling optimistic about integrating these strategies into your routine. Pairing the practice of recognizing your feelings with your journaling can create a powerful feedback loop, reinforcing your progress and helping you navigate those moments of self-doubt. Acknowledging that setbacks are part of the process is key, and it sounds like you’re ready to give yourself that grace. \n\nAs you embark on this journey, remember that it’s okay to have ups and downs. Each step you take, no matter how small, contributes to your growth. When those feelings of inadequacy arise, try to lean into the tools you’re developing. How do you feel about setting a specific time each week to review your journal and reflect on both your achievements and how you managed those feelings? This could help solidify your progress and keep you grounded.\nClient: I think setting a specific time each week to review my journal sounds like a good idea. It creates a routine that I can rely on, and having that time to reflect on my achievements and how I’ve managed my feelings could really help reinforce what I’m trying to build. It feels like a way to honor both my struggles and my progress, which is something I’ve been missing. \n\nI guess having that dedicated time might also help me stay grounded when those feelings of inadequacy creep in. I can remind myself that I have a space to reflect on everything I’ve done, and that might help keep the pressure in check. It feels a bit more manageable to approach it this way, even if I know I’ll still have to navigate those tough moments. \n\nI’m willing to give it a shot and see how it goes. I just hope I can maintain that consistency and not let the self-doubt overshadow it. It’s good to feel like I have some structure to lean on, though, so I appreciate the suggestion.\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that setting a specific time each week for reflection feels manageable and supportive for you. Creating that routine can indeed provide a structured space to honor both your achievements and the challenges you face. It sounds like you're finding a way to balance acknowledging your struggles while also celebrating your progress, which is an important part of this journey. \n\nAs you move forward, remember that it's natural to encounter self-doubt, but having that dedicated time can help you reinforce your growth and keep those feelings in perspective. I encourage you to approach this process with patience and kindness towards yourself. How do you feel about starting this practice, and is there anything else you’d like to discuss or explore further as you prepare to implement these strategies?\nClient: I feel pretty good about starting this practice, honestly. Having that dedicated time each week to reflect on my progress and how I manage those feelings of self-doubt seems like a solid plan. It gives me a sense of structure, which I think I really need right now. I guess I'm just trying to stay hopeful that this will help me shift my perspective and make it easier to deal with those feelings when they come up.\n\nBut I do have this lingering worry about whether I can stick with it. I mean, sometimes I feel like I can be my own worst enemy when it comes to following through on things. I just hope I won’t get too caught up in the cycle of self-doubt again and lose sight of what I’ve learned. \n\nI appreciate the support and the suggestions you've given me. It feels nice to have a plan to work with, and I’m willing to give it a shot. I think I just need to remind myself to be patient with this process. I guess if there’s one thing I’d like to explore a bit more, it’s how to handle those moments when the self-doubt really hits hard. What are some ways to cope in those instances?\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling positive about starting this practice and that it provides you with a sense of structure. Your willingness to give it a shot and remain patient with yourself is an important mindset as you navigate this process. \n\nWhen those moments of self-doubt hit hard, it can be helpful to have a few coping strategies in your toolkit. One approach is to take a step back and practice grounding techniques, such as taking deep breaths or focusing on your surroundings to bring yourself back to the present moment. This can help create a pause before those feelings overwhelm you. \n\nAnother strategy is to refer back to your journal during those tough times. You could read through your reflections on achievements and how you've managed self-doubt in the past. This can serve as a reminder of your resilience and progress. Additionally, consider reaching out to a trusted colleague or friend to talk about what you’re feeling; sometimes, sharing those thoughts can alleviate some of the weight. \n\nHow do these ideas resonate with you, and are there any particular strategies you feel drawn to try when self-doubt arises?\nClient: I really like the idea of using grounding techniques when those feelings of self-doubt hit. Taking deep breaths or focusing on my surroundings sounds like a good way to create a little space before I get overwhelmed. It feels like a simple yet effective way to manage the anxiety that comes with those moments.\n\nReading through my journal during tough times is another strategy that resonates with me. It could be a powerful reminder of my achievements and how I’ve coped with those feelings in the past. I think it might help me reconnect with that sense of progress when I’m feeling low.\n\nReaching out to a trusted colleague or friend is also a good idea. I’ve always found talking things out can lighten the load, even if it feels hard to open up sometimes. It’s nice to have some options to consider when self-doubt creeps in.\n\nI’m feeling more hopeful about having these strategies in place. Even though I know it might still be a struggle, having some concrete ways to cope feels like a step in the right direction. I just hope that with practice, I can get better at managing those feelings and not let them overshadow my progress. Thank you for these suggestions; they really give me something to work with.",
