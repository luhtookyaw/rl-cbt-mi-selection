  "conversation": "Therapist: Hi Caleb, it’s nice to see you. What’s been on your mind that brings you here today?\nClient: I guess I've been thinking about my PhD project a lot. It feels like I should be making more progress, but I don't know... it just seems like I'm stuck. Like, the last bit of work always feels so overwhelming, you know? I mean, I should have finished by now, but here I am, still struggling. It’s just frustrating. I’m not sure what to even say about it.\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Caleb. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming in your PhD project? I'm curious to understand the parts that are making you feel stuck. Also, have there been any moments along the way where you felt like you were making progress?\nClient: Well, it’s just... I feel like there's this pressure to get everything perfect, you know? Like if I don't find something significant or finish all the details just right, then what’s the point? And then I get this nagging thought that I’m just not cut out for this. I mean, I see other people making strides, and I can't help but think, \"Why can't I do that?\" \n\nAs for progress, I guess there have been moments where I felt like I was on the right track. But those moments feel so fleeting, and then it’s back to feeling like I’m in this never-ending loop of doubt. It’s hard to explain, really. I just... I don’t want to keep feeling like this. But talking about it just makes me feel more overwhelmed, to be honest.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're really feeling the weight of being stuck and overwhelmed with your PhD project. The pressure to achieve perfection must be incredibly challenging, especially when it feels like every detail matters so much. I can understand how those brief moments of feeling like you're making progress can quickly be overshadowed by doubt and frustration. It's completely normal to experience these feelings, and many others in similar situations face the same struggles. If you're comfortable, I'd like to hear more about how this is affecting you without any pressure to find a solution right now.\nClient: I appreciate that you understand, but honestly, it’s just hard to dive deeper into this. I mean, I know I’m not the only one feeling this way, but that doesn’t really help me right now, does it? Sometimes it feels like talking about it just makes it worse. I guess I’m just worried that I’ll get stuck in a cycle of overthinking and never really get anywhere. I don't know... I just feel a bit withdrawn, like I’m stuck in my own head and can’t find a way out. It’s frustrating to think about.\nTherapist: It’s clear that you’re experiencing a lot of frustration and feeling withdrawn as you navigate your PhD project. The pressure to achieve perfection seems to weigh heavily on you, contributing to that sense of being stuck. I can see how those fleeting moments of progress are quickly followed by doubt, making it harder to move forward. I'm curious about how discussing these feelings right now is impacting you. Does it feel like it's helping at all, or does it add to the overwhelm?\nClient: I guess it’s a bit of both, honestly. I mean, part of me wants to talk about it because maybe it could help, but then there's this other part that feels like... what’s the point? It just makes me think about all the things that aren’t going right, and I end up feeling even more overwhelmed. I know I should be able to handle this, but here I am, feeling stuck. It’s like I’m caught in this loop where every time I try to express how I feel, it just reinforces that sense of being trapped. I don’t want to keep going around in circles. I don’t know if diving deeper is really going to change anything. It just feels like a lot right now.\nTherapist: I hear you, Caleb, and it sounds like you're caught in a tough cycle where discussing your feelings can feel both necessary and overwhelming at the same time. It’s understandable to feel frustrated when expressing yourself seems to reinforce that sense of being trapped. Can you share more about what specific aspects of your project contribute to that feeling of being overwhelmed? Also, when you think about your progress, what thoughts or emotions come up for you? I’d like to understand more about what you believe might help you feel less stuck in this situation.\nClient: I guess when I think about the specific aspects that overwhelm me, it’s mostly the fear of not measuring up. Like, I keep thinking about how every detail has to be perfect, and if I don’t get it right, then what’s the point of even trying? It’s like I’ve built this wall around myself, and every time I approach my project, I just run into it. And then there’s the whole comparison thing—seeing others making progress just makes me spiral. I start to feel like a failure, and it’s hard to shake that feeling. \n\nAs for my progress, when I think about it, I just feel... I don’t know, anxious? Like I should have achieved so much more by now. It’s frustrating because I know I’ve done some good work, but those moments feel overshadowed by this constant nagging doubt. I just keep thinking, “What if I’m not cut out for this?” It’s exhausting, really. I don’t want to keep rehashing it, but I can’t help but feel stuck. I mean, I appreciate you asking, but I really don’t know how to get out of this loop.\nTherapist: It sounds like the fear of not measuring up is really weighing on you, and I can see how that creates a barrier when you approach your project. The comparison to others and the feelings of anxiety about your progress seem to be intensifying that sense of being trapped. If you could think of any small steps that might help you feel a bit less overwhelmed or less stuck, what might those be? Also, I want to make sure you feel comfortable discussing these feelings further—are there any concerns you have about continuing this conversation?\nClient: I appreciate you asking about small steps, but honestly, I feel like I'm just treading water right now. It's hard to think about taking any steps when I feel so stuck. I mean, even the idea of breaking things down into smaller tasks feels overwhelming because I worry that I won't be able to do them perfectly. It’s like I have this constant fear that if I don’t get things right, then it’s all for nothing. \n\nAs for discussing my feelings further, I guess I’m just kind of hesitant. I don't want to keep going around in circles, and I’m worried about getting deeper into this feeling of being trapped. I know it’s important to talk about things, but part of me just thinks, “What’s the point?” I don’t want to keep feeling like this, but it’s tough to see a way out. I mean, I know I should be able to handle this, but it just feels like a lot right now.\nTherapist: Caleb, it’s clear that the pressure of perfectionism is really holding you back, making it difficult to even consider taking small steps forward. I’d like to invite you to reflect on your values regarding your PhD work and what you hope to achieve through it. How do these feelings of being stuck align or conflict with those values? It might also be helpful to think about any behaviors or thoughts that could be hindering your progress. What would it mean for you to let go of the need for everything to be perfect in this context? Lastly, I want to support you in articulating any motivations you have for change, emphasizing that you have the autonomy to explore this at your own pace.\nClient: I get what you're saying about reflecting on my values and what I want to achieve. It’s just that when I think about my PhD work, I really want to contribute something meaningful—something that feels significant in the field. But then there's this constant pressure to make sure everything is perfect, and I start to feel like I’m letting myself down if I don’t meet those high standards. It’s almost like I’ve set this impossible bar for myself, and now I’m stuck trying to reach it.\n\nLetting go of the need for everything to be perfect? I mean, that sounds nice in theory, but in reality, it feels really scary. What if I let something slip and it affects the outcome of my work? It’s like I’m stuck in this cycle of wanting to do well but being paralyzed by the fear of not measuring up.\n\nAs for motivations for change, I guess I just want to feel more at ease with my work. I want to enjoy the process instead of being consumed by this constant worry. But every time I think about making a change, I get this nagging doubt that makes me question if I’m even capable of it. I don’t know if I’m ready to dive deeper into this right now. It just feels like a lot, and I worry that talking about it more might just make me feel even more trapped.\nTherapist: It’s evident that you’re feeling a significant amount of pressure to achieve something meaningful through your PhD work, and the fear of not meeting those high standards is understandably overwhelming. I can appreciate your hesitance to let go of that need for perfection; it’s a tough position to be in when it feels like so much is at stake. It’s okay to feel stuck and unsure about diving deeper into these feelings, as many people experience similar challenges in their academic journeys. If you feel comfortable, I’d like to invite you to share any small thoughts or feelings that come up as you reflect on your situation—there’s no pressure to find solutions right now.\nClient: I understand that you're trying to help, and I appreciate that. But honestly, it feels like I’m just in this fog, and every time I try to think about it, I end up feeling even more overwhelmed. I mean, the pressure to achieve something significant is like this heavy weight on my shoulders. The idea of letting go of the need for everything to be perfect is just... daunting. What if I miss something important? I feel like I’d be setting myself up for failure. \n\nI guess when I think about it, there’s this part of me that wants to enjoy my work, but then I get pulled back into that cycle of worry. I keep thinking about how I should be doing better, and it just makes it hard to see any way out. I don’t really want to dig too deep right now because I’m worried it’ll just lead to more frustration. So, I guess I’m just stuck in this place of wanting to move forward but feeling like I can't, you know? I just feel a bit lost.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're really feeling the weight of that pressure to achieve something significant, and I can understand how daunting the idea of letting go of perfectionism can be. It’s completely normal to feel lost when you're caught in that cycle of worry, especially when you want to enjoy your work but feel pulled back by those thoughts of inadequacy. I want to acknowledge how tough this is for you. If you're open to it, we can take our time exploring these feelings together. You’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to share any small thoughts or feelings that come up as we talk. There’s absolutely no rush to find solutions right now. How does that feel for you?\nClient: I appreciate you saying that, and I guess it feels a bit reassuring to know I'm not alone in this. But still, I’m just really hesitant to dive deeper. I keep thinking that talking about it might just lead to more frustration, you know? It’s like I’m already on edge, and I don’t want to amplify that feeling. \n\nI mean, I get that it’s important to explore these feelings, but it feels like every time I try to articulate what's going on in my head, I just end up feeling more lost. I just don’t want to keep going around in circles. I think, for now, I’d prefer to maybe focus on some practical steps rather than digging deeper into emotions that just feel overwhelming. I’m not sure how to move forward, but I guess I’m just trying to find a way out of this fog without getting too caught up in it.\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Caleb, and it makes sense that you're feeling hesitant to dive deeper right now. It sounds like focusing on practical steps could be a helpful way to navigate through this fog. Can you share any specific practical steps you might consider to feel less overwhelmed with your PhD work? Also, what small changes do you think could help you feel more at ease as you move forward? Let's explore what feels manageable for you in this moment.\nClient: I guess when I think about practical steps, it feels like I should really break things down into smaller tasks, but even that feels daunting. I mean, what if I can't do them perfectly? But, maybe I could try setting aside a specific time each week just to focus on my project, even if it's just an hour or so. That way, it’s not like I’m diving in headfirst, but I’m still making some kind of effort. \n\nI suppose I could also try to remind myself that it’s okay if things aren’t perfect. Like, maybe I could focus on simply making progress instead of worrying about the end result. I think acknowledging that I’m doing my best, even if it doesn't feel like enough, might help a little. \n\nBut honestly, it just feels like a lot to think about right now. I’m worried that these small changes won’t be enough to pull me out of this fog. I don’t want to feel stuck, but at the same time, I’m not sure if I can do it. So, I guess I’m just trying to figure out what feels right without feeling overwhelmed by it all, you know?\nTherapist: It sounds like you're starting to identify some practical steps that could help you move forward, and I appreciate you sharing those thoughts. Setting aside specific time each week to focus on your project seems like a manageable way to ease into it, and I can see how that might help you feel less overwhelmed. I’d like to invite you to share more about your thoughts on breaking tasks into smaller steps—how does that resonate with you? When you consider setting aside time for your project, what specific feelings come up for you? Reflecting on any past experiences where small changes led to progress could be valuable as well. Lastly, I want to check in on how you feel about discussing these practical steps and if you have any concerns about that.\nClient: I mean, breaking tasks down into smaller steps sounds like a good idea in theory, but I can't shake the feeling that it just might not be enough, you know? Like, what if I set those small goals and still end up feeling overwhelmed? It's like I keep thinking about how I should be able to handle this, but sometimes it just feels impossible. \n\nWhen I think about setting aside time for my project, there's this mix of anxiety and a tiny spark of hope. It feels good to think that I could actually start making some progress, but then I worry about what happens if I don’t stick to it. I guess it’s that fear of letting myself down again, which just adds to the weight of it all. \n\nI mean, I’ve had moments in the past where I’ve made small changes, and they did help a bit, but those feelings of doubt always come creeping back. It’s exhausting to keep battling that cycle. I appreciate you asking about these practical steps, but I still feel hesitant about whether they’ll really make a difference. I hope it’s okay to feel this way, but I just want to make sure I’m not setting myself up for more frustration.\nTherapist: It’s clear that you’re feeling a lot of pressure and uncertainty around breaking tasks down into smaller steps, and I understand how that fear of not being able to handle it can be quite overwhelming. It’s completely normal to have mixed feelings about setting aside time for your project—there’s that hope for progress, but also anxiety about the possibility of not following through. It’s understandable to feel hesitant about whether these practical steps will truly make a difference, especially when doubt has been a recurring theme for you. \n\nI want to emphasize that it’s okay to feel this way, and many people experience similar challenges when trying to implement changes. If you’re comfortable, I’d like to invite you to share any additional thoughts or feelings that come to mind as we discuss these practical steps. There’s no pressure to find solutions right now; I’m here to support you in whatever way feels right for you.\nClient: I appreciate your understanding, and I guess it’s just hard to shake these doubts. I mean, I want to believe that these small steps could help, but there’s this nagging voice in my head that keeps saying it won’t be enough. I guess part of me is just tired of feeling stuck, and I don’t want to keep going through this cycle of trying and failing. \n\nWhen I think about sharing more thoughts, I just feel a bit frozen. It’s like I know I should be able to articulate what I’m feeling, but the words just don’t come. I keep thinking about how I should be further along in my project, and that makes it hard to talk about what might help. \n\nI do appreciate that you’re here to support me, but I’m still feeling hesitant about diving deeper or exploring too much. I guess right now, I just want to take it one step at a time, but I don’t want to feel overwhelmed by it all. I hope that makes sense.\nTherapist: I hear you, Caleb, and it’s completely understandable to feel frozen when doubts and expectations weigh heavily on you. The desire to believe that small steps could make a difference is often overshadowed by that nagging voice of uncertainty, and it’s exhausting to feel stuck in that cycle of trying and failing. It’s okay to take things one step at a time, and I want to reassure you that there’s no rush to dive deeper into anything that feels overwhelming. \n\nIf you’re comfortable, I’d like to encourage you to share any small thoughts or feelings that arise as we continue this conversation. Remember, there’s no pressure to articulate everything perfectly; we can take it slow and explore whatever feels manageable for you in this moment. How does that sound?\nClient: I appreciate that, and it does help to know that I can take things at my own pace. I guess when I think about sharing small thoughts, there's this part of me that wants to express how frustrating it is to feel so stuck and yet feel like I can’t quite find the right words. I keep thinking about how I should be able to articulate everything clearly, but then I just end up feeling more overwhelmed and trapped in my head.\n\nIt’s like I want to move forward, but every time I try to think about what’s next, I feel that pressure creeping back in. I know I’ve had moments of clarity in the past, but they feel so distant right now. It’s hard to remember what it was like to feel even a little bit confident in my work. \n\nI guess I’m just worried that if I open up too much, it could lead to more frustration, and I don't want to end up spiraling again. So, for now, I think focusing on those small steps is the best approach, even if I’m not entirely sure they’ll help. It just feels a bit like a balancing act, trying to navigate between wanting to share and feeling overwhelmed. I hope that makes sense.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're really grappling with the frustration of feeling stuck while also wanting to express yourself, and I can understand how that pressure to articulate everything clearly adds to your overwhelm. It’s completely valid to feel that tension between wanting to move forward and the fear of opening up too much. Taking small steps feels like a practical approach, and it's okay to focus on that for now. \n\nI want to reassure you that it's perfectly normal to have moments of clarity feel distant, and many people experience similar feelings in their journeys. If you’re comfortable, I’d like to encourage you to share any small thoughts or feelings that come up, even if they feel fleeting. There’s no pressure to articulate everything perfectly, and I’m here to support you at your own pace. How does that resonate with you?\nClient: I appreciate you saying that, and it’s nice to know that I don’t have to have everything figured out right now. I guess when I think about sharing small thoughts, I just feel this tightness in my chest. It’s like I know I should be able to express myself, but the more I think about it, the more overwhelmed I feel. \n\nI keep coming back to that pressure of needing to do everything perfectly. It’s exhausting to think about, and I wonder if I’m just setting myself up for more frustration by trying to articulate all of this. I mean, I want to feel confident in my work again, but that seems so far away. \n\nMaybe focusing on those small steps can help, even if I’m not convinced they’ll make a huge difference. I just don’t want to spiral again, you know? It feels like a balancing act between wanting to share and feeling like I might get lost in it all. I hope that makes sense, and I appreciate your willingness to let me take my time with this.\nTherapist: Caleb, I can really sense the tightness in your chest and the pressure you're feeling to express yourself perfectly. It’s understandable to feel exhausted by that need for everything to be flawless, especially when it seems to overshadow your desire to feel confident in your work. I want to acknowledge how challenging it is to navigate that balancing act between wanting to share and fearing that it might lead to feeling lost or overwhelmed. \n\nIt’s completely okay to take your time with this process, and I want to reassure you that your feelings are valid. If you feel ready, we can explore those small steps together at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Remember, it’s okay to express whatever comes to mind, even if it feels like just a small thought. I'm here to support you in whatever way feels right for you.\nClient: I appreciate your understanding, and it does help to know that I can take my time. I guess when I think about those small steps, I feel a bit of relief, but that tightness in my chest is still there. It’s like I want to believe that focusing on smaller tasks could lead to some progress, but I’m still hung up on that fear of not doing them perfectly. \n\nI want to feel more confident in my work again, but it just feels so distant right now. I keep worrying that if I share too much or dig too deep, I might end up feeling overwhelmed again. It’s frustrating because I want to move forward, but it’s hard to shake that feeling of being stuck. \n\nMaybe starting with just setting aside that time each week could help, but I still wonder if it’ll be enough to really make a difference. I appreciate that you’re encouraging me to take it slow, and I hope that by focusing on these small steps, I can find a way through this fog without getting too caught up in everything. It just feels like a lot to navigate right now, and I hope that makes sense.\nTherapist: It’s really encouraging to hear that focusing on those small steps brings you a bit of relief, even as you still feel that tightness in your chest. It’s completely understandable to have concerns about not doing things perfectly, especially when you’re striving for confidence in your work. The desire to move forward while feeling stuck can be incredibly frustrating, and it’s okay to acknowledge that complexity. \n\nStarting with setting aside that specific time each week sounds like a manageable way to ease into your project, and I want to emphasize that it’s perfectly fine to take this process one step at a time. If you feel comfortable, I’d like to invite you to reflect on any past experiences where taking small steps led to progress—how did that feel for you? Remember, there’s no rush, and we can explore this at your own pace. How does that sound to you?\nClient: I appreciate you asking me to reflect on past experiences. I guess there have been times when I’ve taken small steps, like when I set aside time to write or brainstorm ideas for my project. Those moments felt good, even if they were fleeting. It was like I could see a little bit of progress, and that gave me some hope. But then, it seems like the doubts always creep back in, and I end up feeling like I’m back at square one. \n\nThinking about it now, those small victories did help me feel a bit more connected to my work, but they never seemed to last. I just keep worrying that if I try to do that again, I might not be able to maintain it. It’s like I want to hold onto that feeling of accomplishment, but the pressure to be perfect makes it so hard to enjoy it. \n\nSo, I guess I’m just trying to figure out how to keep that momentum going without feeling overwhelmed. It’s frustrating to feel like I’m constantly battling these thoughts, and I don’t want to spiral down again. I really hope that focusing on those small steps will help, but it still feels daunting. I appreciate your support in letting me take my time with this.\nTherapist: It’s great to hear that you’ve experienced moments of connection to your work through those small victories, even if they felt fleeting. I can understand how frustrating it must be to have doubts creep back in and make it difficult to maintain that sense of accomplishment. The pressure to be perfect can really overshadow those positive experiences, and it’s completely valid to feel that way. \n\nAs you think about keeping that momentum going, I want to acknowledge how challenging it can be to navigate those feelings of overwhelm. If you’re open to it, I’d like to encourage you to consider what it might feel like to let go of some of that pressure, even just a little. What would it be like to allow yourself to celebrate those small steps without the weight of perfectionism? Remember, you don’t have to have everything figured out right now—taking it one step at a time is perfectly okay. How does that resonate with you?\nClient: I appreciate you saying that, and I guess it does make sense to think about celebrating those small steps. It’s just that letting go of that pressure feels really hard. I keep thinking that if I don’t hold myself to high standards, then I might end up not trying hard enough, you know? It’s like I’m afraid that if I allow myself to feel satisfied with small progress, I’ll lose the drive to push further. \n\nBut at the same time, I do recognize that those small victories have felt good in the past, even if they seem short-lived. So, maybe there’s a way to celebrate them without losing sight of my goals. I just feel a bit cautious about it all, worried that I might spiral into that doubt again. I guess I’m just trying to find a balance between being proud of what I accomplish, no matter how small, and still pushing myself to keep going. \n\nI appreciate your support in letting me take my time with this, and I hope it’s okay to still feel a bit unsure about how to navigate it all. It just feels like a lot right now, and I’m still figuring out what feels right for me.\nTherapist: Caleb, I can really sense the struggle you're experiencing between wanting to celebrate those small victories and the fear that it might diminish your drive to push further. It’s completely understandable to feel cautious about letting go of that pressure, especially when you’ve tied your sense of accomplishment to high standards. It’s a tough balancing act, and it’s okay to feel unsure about how to navigate it. \n\nI want to validate your feelings and remind you that it’s perfectly fine to take your time with this process. If you feel comfortable, I’d like to encourage you to share any small thoughts or feelings that come up as you reflect on this balance. There’s no pressure to have everything figured out right now; we can explore this together at a pace that feels manageable for you. How does that sound?\nClient: I appreciate your encouragement to share my thoughts, and it’s reassuring to know that I can take my time with this. I guess when I reflect on that balance between celebrating small victories and maintaining my drive, it feels like a tightrope walk. On one hand, I know those small wins can be a source of motivation, but on the other hand, I worry that if I focus too much on them, I might lose sight of my bigger goals.\n\nThere’s also this fear that if I allow myself to feel satisfied, it might lead to complacency. I keep thinking about how I should be pushing myself harder, and that internal pressure just makes it tough to enjoy any progress I make. It’s frustrating because I want to feel proud of what I accomplish, but I also don’t want to end up feeling stuck again.\n\nI guess it’s just that constant tug-of-war between wanting to be kind to myself and the fear of not living up to my potential. I’m hopeful that by focusing on those small steps, I can start to find that balance. But it still feels daunting, you know? I appreciate you being patient with me as I work through these feelings.\nTherapist: It’s clear that you’re navigating a complex emotional landscape, Caleb, and I appreciate you sharing those thoughts. The tightrope walk between celebrating small victories and maintaining your drive is a common struggle, and it’s understandable to feel that internal pressure to push yourself harder. It’s completely valid to worry about complacency, especially when you have high aspirations for your work. \n\nI want to acknowledge the frustration you’re feeling in wanting to be proud of your accomplishments while also fearing that it might lead to feeling stuck again. It’s okay to experience that tug-of-war between self-kindness and striving for your potential. If you’re open to it, I’d like to invite you to recall a specific moment when you felt overwhelmed by perfectionism in the past. What was the exact thought you had at that moment? Let’s capture that thought together, and we can explore how it influences your emotions and behaviors regarding your PhD work.\nClient: I appreciate you inviting me to reflect on a specific moment. I guess one that stands out was when I was nearing a deadline for a paper I was working on. I remember feeling this intense pressure to make everything perfect—the wording, the data, all of it. I kept thinking, “If this isn’t flawless, I’ll be a failure.” That thought just consumed me, and instead of focusing on finishing, I got so caught up in trying to make it perfect that I ended up paralyzed. \n\nI felt like I was letting myself down because I couldn’t meet that impossible standard I set for myself. It was frustrating because I knew I had a lot of good ideas, but that thought of perfectionism overshadowed any progress I could have made. I ended up missing the deadline and felt even worse about myself. It’s like that moment highlighted how crippling those thoughts can be, and I really don’t want to go through that again. \n\nSo, I guess I still wonder how I can approach my work without getting stuck in that cycle again. I appreciate you helping me unpack this, but it’s still daunting to think about how those thoughts can creep back in.\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that specific moment, Caleb. It sounds like that thought, “If this isn’t flawless, I’ll be a failure,” really had a significant impact on your emotions and behaviors during that time. It’s understandable how that kind of pressure could lead to paralysis and ultimately missing the deadline, which only added to your frustration and sense of letting yourself down. \n\nReflecting on how that thought affected you, I’d like to encourage you to consider what evidence supports that belief and what evidence might contradict it. What experiences or outcomes have shown you that perfection isn’t the only measure of success? Exploring this could help us understand how those thoughts have shaped your feelings and actions in the past. How does that sound to you?\nClient: I appreciate you guiding me to reflect on the evidence around that belief. I guess when I think about it, I’ve had moments where I’ve received positive feedback on my work, even when I didn’t feel it was perfect. Like that time I presented at a conference, and people seemed to connect with my ideas, even though I thought I could have done better. \n\nBut then, I often dismiss those moments, telling myself it was just luck or that people were being nice. I get stuck in that cycle of thinking I have to be perfect to be taken seriously or to validate my work. It’s frustrating because I know deep down that perfection isn’t realistic, yet it feels like my mind keeps going back to that standard. \n\nI guess it’s hard to hold onto those positive moments when the pressure feels so overwhelming. I really want to find a way to remind myself that I can still succeed without everything being flawless. I appreciate you helping me unpack this, but it still feels daunting to challenge those thoughts head-on. I hope it’s okay that I’m still working through this.\nTherapist: It’s really insightful that you’ve identified those moments of positive feedback, even when you didn’t feel your work was perfect. It’s understandable to dismiss those experiences as luck or kindness, especially when the pressure to meet high standards feels so overwhelming. Recognizing that perfection isn’t realistic is an important step, and it’s okay to feel daunted by the challenge of confronting those thoughts. \n\nIf you’re comfortable, I’d like to invite you to reflect on how those positive experiences contradict the belief that only perfection leads to validation. What patterns do you notice in your thinking about success and perfection? Let’s explore how you can reframe your definition of success to include progress and effort, not just perfection. How does that resonate with you?\nClient: I appreciate you guiding me to reflect on those positive experiences. When I think about how they contradict that belief about needing to be perfect, it feels like there’s a bit of a shift happening, but it’s still hard to let go of that ingrained idea. I notice that I often equate success with perfection, and when I don’t meet that standard, I feel like I’ve failed, even if others see value in my work. \n\nIt’s frustrating because I know that focusing solely on perfection is unrealistic, yet it’s like a default setting in my mind. I want to reframe what success means to me, but the fear of not living up to my own expectations keeps creeping back in. I think it might help to remind myself that progress and effort are valid measures of success, but actually believing that and applying it to my work feels daunting. \n\nI guess I’m still wrestling with how to shift my mindset while managing that pressure, and I really appreciate your patience as I work through this. It feels like I’m slowly starting to see a different perspective, but it’s definitely a process. I hope it’s okay to still feel a bit uncertain about it all.\nTherapist: It’s encouraging to hear that you’re starting to notice a shift in your perspective, even as you continue to grapple with those ingrained beliefs about perfection and success. Acknowledging that progress and effort are valid measures of success is an important realization, and it’s completely understandable to feel daunted by the process of truly believing and applying that to your work. \n\nAs you reflect on this, I’d like to invite you to articulate a new definition of success for yourself. What might that look like if it included elements of progress and effort, rather than just perfection? Let’s explore how you can create a more balanced view of success that feels attainable and meaningful to you. How does that feel to consider?\nClient: I appreciate you encouraging me to articulate a new definition of success. When I think about it, I guess success could mean making consistent progress, no matter how small, and feeling a sense of accomplishment in the effort I put in. Maybe it’s about recognizing that each step, even if it’s not perfect, brings me closer to my goals. It could also involve celebrating the learning process and acknowledging that setbacks are part of growth.\n\nI think it might help to remind myself that success doesn’t have to look a certain way—like a perfectly finished project. Instead, maybe it could be about my willingness to engage with my work, to show up for myself, and to take those small steps toward my larger goals. \n\nBut I still find myself hesitant because that inner voice keeps saying that if I lower my standards, I might not push myself hard enough. It feels like I’m trying to balance being kind to myself while also wanting to strive for excellence. I hope it’s okay that I’m still working through this, and I appreciate the space you’re giving me to explore these thoughts.\nTherapist: It’s wonderful to hear you articulate this new definition of success, Caleb. Recognizing that success can be about consistent progress, effort, and celebrating the learning process is a significant step forward. It’s completely natural to feel hesitant about lowering your standards, especially when you have such high aspirations. Balancing self-kindness with the desire for excellence can be challenging, and it’s okay to navigate that tension as you redefine what success means to you. \n\nIf you feel ready, I’d like to support you in creating a plan to remind yourself of this new perspective when those feelings of perfectionism arise. What strategies or affirmations could you incorporate to help reinforce this more balanced view of success? Let’s explore what might work for you in those moments of doubt. How does that sound?\nClient: I appreciate your encouragement to create a plan to reinforce this new perspective on success. I think having some strategies in place could really help me when those feelings of perfectionism start to creep back in. \n\nMaybe I could start by writing down that definition of success I just articulated, so I have a physical reminder of what I want to focus on. I could also create a list of affirmations related to progress and effort, something simple like “Every step counts” or “I’m showing up for myself.” That might help shift my mindset when I start feeling overwhelmed. \n\nI guess I could also set aside a few moments each week to reflect on what I’ve accomplished, even if it feels small. Just taking the time to acknowledge that progress could help me stay connected to my work without getting caught up in perfectionism. \n\nBut I still feel a bit cautious about this. I worry that, even with these strategies, that inner voice might still push me to be harder on myself. It’s frustrating because I want to believe in this new perspective, but it feels like a constant battle. I appreciate your support in helping me think through this, and I hope it’s okay that I’m still figuring it all out.\nTherapist: It’s great to hear that you’re considering practical strategies to reinforce your new perspective on success. Writing down your definition and creating affirmations like “Every step counts” can serve as powerful reminders when those feelings of perfectionism arise. Setting aside time each week to reflect on your accomplishments, no matter how small, is also a wonderful way to stay connected to your progress. \n\nI want to acknowledge the caution you feel about that inner voice pushing you to be harder on yourself. It’s completely normal to experience that tension as you work towards this new mindset. If you’re open to it, let’s explore how you can gently challenge that inner voice when it comes up. What might you say to yourself in those moments to remind yourself of the value of progress and effort? How does that resonate with you?\nClient: I appreciate you helping me think about how to gently challenge that inner voice. I guess one thing I could say to myself is, “It’s okay to not have everything perfect right now; what matters is that I’m making progress.” That might help me shift my focus from the pressure of perfection to recognizing the value in my efforts. \n\nAnother thought could be, “Each step, no matter how small, brings me closer to my goals,” reminding myself that it’s a journey rather than a race. I think having those kinds of affirmations ready could help me counteract that critical voice when it starts to get loud. \n\nBut even with those strategies, I still find myself feeling a bit anxious about whether I’ll actually remember to use them in those moments of doubt. It feels like a lot to manage, and I worry that I might fall back into old habits. I really do want to believe in this new perspective, but it seems like a continuous effort. I hope it’s okay to still feel a little uncertain about it all, and I appreciate you being patient with me as I navigate this process.\nTherapist: It’s encouraging to hear the affirmations you’ve come up with to challenge that inner voice, Caleb. Phrases like “It’s okay to not have everything perfect right now; what matters is that I’m making progress” and “Each step, no matter how small, brings me closer to my goals” can be powerful reminders to help shift your focus. It’s completely understandable to feel anxious about whether you’ll remember to use these strategies in moments of doubt, especially as you work to establish new habits. \n\nTo support you in this process, how about we create a plan for integrating these affirmations into your routine? Perhaps you could write them down and keep them somewhere visible, or set reminders on your phone to prompt you when you feel that pressure building. Additionally, we can think about how to review your progress each week, which could reinforce your commitment to this new perspective. How does that sound to you?\nClient: I appreciate your suggestions for integrating those affirmations into my routine. Writing them down and keeping them visible sounds like a good idea—having that physical reminder could really help reinforce what I'm trying to focus on. Setting reminders on my phone might be useful, too, especially during those moments when the pressure starts to creep back in. \n\nI think reviewing my progress each week could also be a helpful way to stay connected to my efforts. It feels like a tangible way to celebrate those small victories and remind myself that I’m moving forward, even if it doesn’t feel perfect. \n\nBut I still feel a bit hesitant about sticking to this plan consistently. I worry that I might forget to use the affirmations or that I’ll fall back into old habits when I get overwhelmed. It’s frustrating to feel like I’m constantly battling with that inner voice. I hope it’s okay to still feel this uncertainty, and I really appreciate your patience as I work through all of this. It feels like a lot to navigate, but I’m hopeful that with these strategies, I can start to make some progress.\nTherapist: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling positive about the strategies we’ve discussed, Caleb. Writing down your affirmations and keeping them visible, along with setting reminders, can definitely help reinforce your focus on progress. It’s completely normal to feel hesitant about sticking to the plan consistently, especially when you’re navigating those feelings of overwhelm. \n\nI want to reassure you that it’s okay to experience uncertainty as you work through this process. Remember, building new habits takes time, and it’s perfectly fine to have moments where you might forget or slip back into old patterns. If that happens, it’s an opportunity to gently remind yourself of your new perspective and the progress you’ve made. \n\nAs you move forward, let’s think about how you can track your progress and reflect on your experiences with these strategies. What methods do you think would work best for you in monitoring how you’re doing with your affirmations and celebrating those small victories? How does that feel to consider?\nClient: I appreciate you reminding me that it's okay to feel uncertain as I navigate this process. It helps to know that building new habits takes time, and I don't have to be perfect right away. \n\nFor tracking my progress, I think it might be useful to keep a journal where I can jot down my thoughts, how I used the affirmations, and any small victories I noticed throughout the week. That way, I can see my progress laid out in front of me, which could help reinforce that sense of accomplishment. \n\nI could also set aside a specific time each week to review what I’ve written and reflect on how I felt about my progress. It would be a good way to celebrate those small wins and remind myself that it's about the journey, not just the end result. \n\nBut I still feel a bit apprehensive about whether I’ll consistently remember to do this. It feels like a lot to manage, and I worry I might slip back into my old habits of perfectionism. I guess I'm just trying to find that balance between being committed to this new approach while also being kind to myself if I don't stick to it perfectly. I really appreciate your support and understanding as I work through these feelings. It feels like a step in the right direction, even if it's daunting.",
