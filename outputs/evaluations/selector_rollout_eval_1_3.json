  "conversation": "Therapist: Hi Alex, it's good to see you. I'm curious to know what’s on your mind today and what brings you to therapy.\nClient: I don’t know, I guess I’m just here because I feel like I have to be. I mean, it’s not like anything ever really changes, right? I just keep dealing with the same stuff over and over again. Like yesterday, I was supposed to pick up my girlfriend after work, and of course, it started raining right when I was about to leave. It’s just my luck, you know? I felt so mad about it, like why does this always happen to me? It's frustrating. I don’t really want to dig into my feelings about it or anything, but that’s what happened.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're feeling quite frustrated with how things seem to repeat themselves in your life. Can you share more about what emotions come up for you when you say that nothing ever changes? I'm also interested in hearing about any past experiences where you've felt similarly. What do you hope to achieve through our time together? Additionally, what specific thoughts or beliefs do you have about the challenges you're facing right now? Lastly, what parts of your life feel most important for us to focus on today?\nClient: I mean, I guess I just feel angry and a bit hopeless. Like, why bother trying when it seems like nothing's going to get better? It's like I'm stuck in this loop, and every time I think I'm making progress, something happens to remind me that I'm just... not in control. I don’t really want to go digging into all that past stuff right now, it just feels exhausting. I just want to get through the day without feeling like such a victim of my circumstances. As for what I hope to achieve, I don't know, maybe just some clarity or something? It’s hard to focus on what really matters when I'm just trying to keep my head above water. But yeah, I guess we can talk about whatever you think is important. I just hope it’s not going to be all about my feelings, because that’s not really my thing.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of anger and a sense of hopelessness, feeling trapped in a cycle where you can't gain control over your circumstances. When you mention feeling \"stuck,\" what does that really mean for you? I understand that you might not want to delve into past issues right now, and I respect that. Can you think of any specific moments that contribute to this feeling of being a victim of your situation? And as we discuss these experiences, how do you feel about guiding our conversation today?\nClient: I mean, \"stuck\" just feels like I’m in this never-ending cycle, you know? Every time I think things might change, something else pops up that just knocks me back down. Like with my family, it's always the same arguments and the same feelings of rejection. It's exhausting to even think about. I’d rather not relive those moments right now; it just makes me feel worse. \n\nI guess I just want to keep it simple and focus on the here and now. I don’t want to get too deep into the past or all my feelings. I know it’s probably important or whatever, but it just feels like a lot. So, if we can talk about what to do moving forward instead of going back, that would be better for me.\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Alex, and I hear your desire to focus on the present and what you can do moving forward. What specific changes would you like to see in your daily life that could help you feel more in control? I'm also curious about any small steps you think you could take to start making those changes. Are there any current situations in your life that feel manageable enough for us to discuss? Additionally, what aspects of your life do you feel are most important to address right now? Finally, how do you envision a positive outcome from our sessions together?\nClient: I guess I just want to feel like I can handle things better, you know? Like, even small stuff. Maybe not getting so upset when things don’t go my way, like with the rain yesterday. I mean, it’s just weather, right? But it gets to me. I think if I could figure out a way to not let those little things throw me off, that would help. \n\nAs for taking steps, I don’t know, maybe I could try not to reach for a beer when I’m feeling frustrated. Like, find something else to do instead of just escaping into that. But honestly, it feels overwhelming to think about changing everything all at once. \n\nRight now, I think the most important thing is just figuring out how to stop feeling so angry and helpless every time something happens. I don’t know what a positive outcome looks like yet, but I guess I just want to feel a bit more in control and less like a victim of everything around me. But I still don’t want to dig too deep into feelings or the past; it’s just too much to handle.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're recognizing the impact that small situations, like the rain, have on your emotions and how you respond to them. Can you identify one specific situation in your daily life where you feel you could handle things better? I’d like to hear what that would look like in practice for you. Additionally, what small changes do you think you could realistically implement to help with that? And as you think about these changes, what kind of support do you feel you might need to make them happen? Lastly, how would it feel for you to take even a small step toward feeling more in control?\nClient: I mean, I guess I could think about those moments when I just get really worked up over things that aren’t that big of a deal. Like when I’m waiting for my girlfriend and she’s late or something. Instead of getting all angry and frustrated, maybe I could take a breath and just distract myself with something else, like my phone or a podcast. \n\nAs for small changes, I could try to take a walk instead of reaching for a beer when I feel that frustration building up. But even that feels like a lot sometimes. Honestly, I just don’t want to feel like I'm constantly fighting against my own emotions. \n\nSupport? I guess just having someone to talk to when I feel like I’m about to lose it would help. But I don’t want it to feel like a big deal, you know? I don’t want to turn every little thing into some huge emotional breakdown. Taking even a small step seems daunting, but if I could just find a moment of calm, maybe that would be a start. But I don't want to get too deep into all that right now. Just feels heavy.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the emotions that come up in those everyday moments, like waiting for your girlfriend. I appreciate your desire to keep things focused on the present, and it's great to hear that you're recognizing the importance of handling small situations better. I’d love to hear more about your thoughts on taking a walk instead of reaching for a beer when frustration hits. What do you think that experience would be like for you? Remember, it’s perfectly okay to take small steps without feeling like you have to tackle everything at once.\nClient: I mean, taking a walk sounds like a decent idea, right? It’s like a way to get out of my head for a bit and maybe clear my thoughts. I can picture myself just stepping outside, getting some fresh air, and maybe even noticing things around me instead of just being stuck in my own frustrations. \n\nBut then again, there’s that voice in my head that’s like, “What if it doesn’t help? What if I still end up feeling the same way?” I don’t want to set myself up for disappointment. It just feels like there’s so much pressure to make it work, you know? \n\nI guess it’s just easier to reach for a beer because I know that’ll calm me down immediately. But if I could actually get myself to go for a walk instead, I think it could be a step in the right direction. I just don’t want it to turn into another thing that feels like a big deal. It’s all a bit overwhelming. I just want to figure out how to deal with these little moments without feeling like I’m about to lose it.\nTherapist: It’s encouraging to hear that you see taking a walk as a potential way to clear your mind and step away from frustration. Can you share more about what that walk would look like for you in practice? What specific thoughts or feelings come up when you consider making that change? Additionally, what barriers do you think might stand in the way of you taking that walk instead of reaching for a beer? As you think about this, what kind of support do you feel you might need to feel more comfortable taking that step? Finally, how would you feel about committing to even a small step toward this goal in the coming week?\nClient: I mean, picturing the walk, I can see myself just stepping outside, maybe walking around the block or something. It feels like it could be a nice change of pace, you know? Just getting away from whatever’s bugging me. But then there’s that nagging thought that it might not be enough. Like, what if I still feel frustrated afterward? I don’t want to feel let down or like I’m wasting my time. \n\nAs for barriers, I guess sometimes it’s just easier to stay in my comfort zone, even if that means reaching for a beer. It’s like, why bother with something that might not work when I have a quick fix right here? Plus, I worry that if I go for a walk, I’ll just end up overthinking things even more. \n\nSupport? I think just having someone check in on me would help. Like, if I tell someone I’m trying to take a walk instead of drinking, maybe that would keep me accountable? But I really don’t want it to feel like a big deal; I just want to keep it simple. \n\nCommitting to it this week feels a bit daunting, but I guess if I could just try once and see how it goes, that might be okay. I just don’t want to feel like I’m turning it into a huge emotional thing, you know? But yeah, I guess I could give it a shot and see if it helps take the edge off.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of hope and hesitation about the idea of taking a walk as a way to manage your frustration. I hear you wanting to keep things simple and not turn this into a big emotional ordeal. It's completely valid to feel concerned about whether it will be enough or if it might lead to overthinking. I appreciate your willingness to consider trying it at least once this week; that’s a meaningful step. Can you think of a specific time or situation when you might be able to fit that walk in? Also, I want to acknowledge that it’s okay to take things one step at a time without the pressure to change everything all at once.\nClient: I mean, I could probably fit a walk in after work, right? Like, if it's nice out and I’m not too wrapped up in my day, I could just take a few minutes to step outside before heading home. It feels manageable when I think of it that way. \n\nBut then there’s that part of me that worries I’ll just forget or get caught up in my routine. I guess I could set a reminder on my phone or something to help me remember. But even that feels a bit like I'm putting pressure on myself. \n\nHonestly, just thinking about it makes me feel a bit lighter, like maybe it could be a way to break up the day. I just hope I don’t end up overthinking it when I’m out there. I’d like to keep it simple and not turn it into some big thing. But yeah, I think I can give it a try and see how it goes.\nTherapist: It’s great to hear that you’re considering fitting a walk in after work; that sounds like a manageable way to incorporate it into your routine. I can sense the hopefulness in your thoughts about how it might help break up your day. It’s completely understandable to worry about forgetting or getting caught up in your usual patterns, and setting a reminder could be a helpful tool to keep you on track without feeling too pressured. I appreciate your desire to keep this simple and not turn it into something overwhelming. As you think about this, what would it mean for you to take that small step without feeling burdened by expectations?\nClient: I mean, taking that small step feels kind of freeing, you know? It's like if I can just get outside and take a walk, it might help me feel a bit more in control, even if it’s just for a little while. I don't want to turn it into this big deal where I’m stressing over every little thing, but just stepping outside could really help break that cycle. \n\nIf I can manage to do it without thinking too much about it, maybe it won’t feel like such a chore or a pressure. I guess it would mean that I’m actually trying to do something different, instead of just falling back into my usual habits. And it might even show me that I can handle these moments without reaching for a beer. \n\nBut I still have that worry in the back of my mind, like what if it doesn’t help, or what if I end up feeling just as frustrated afterwards? I guess I’ll just have to see how it goes and try to keep my expectations low. It’s like a small step toward feeling less like a victim of my own emotions, which is nice to think about.\nTherapist: It’s encouraging to hear that taking that small step feels freeing for you, and I appreciate your desire to keep it simple and manageable. It sounds like you’re recognizing the potential for a walk to help you feel more in control and break that cycle of frustration. As you think about this, what specific thoughts or feelings come up when you consider the possibility of it not helping? Additionally, what kind of support would you find helpful as you try this out, so it feels less like a chore? Lastly, how do you feel about committing to that walk this week, knowing that it’s just one small step in your journey?\nClient: I mean, when I think about it not helping, there's that nagging voice in my head that says, \"See? You knew it wouldn't work.\" It’s just frustrating to feel like I’m trying something new and then end up disappointed. I don’t want to set myself up for failure or feel like I wasted my time. But I guess I need to remind myself that it's just one walk, and it doesn't have to solve everything.\n\nAs for support, I think just knowing that I can talk to you about how it went afterward would help. Like, if I can share what happened, whether it went well or not, it would make it feel less like a big deal. I don’t want it to turn into a whole emotional process; I just want it to be a simple thing I can try.\n\nCommitting to it this week feels okay. I mean, I know it’s just one small step, right? If I can keep it low-pressure, I think I can manage it. I guess it’s just about taking that step and seeing how it feels without putting too much weight on it. So yeah, I think I’ll give it a shot.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're really grappling with that inner voice that questions whether trying something new will actually make a difference. I appreciate your awareness of that feeling and how you’re reminding yourself that it’s just one walk and doesn’t need to solve everything. It’s great that you see the value in having a space to talk about your experience afterward, regardless of the outcome. Keeping it low-pressure is a wise approach, and I admire your commitment to giving it a try this week. As you prepare for this small step, what feelings or thoughts come up for you about the potential for it to be a positive experience?\nClient: I mean, thinking about it being a positive experience feels a bit hopeful, right? Like, maybe I could actually enjoy the walk and find some peace, even if it’s just for a little bit. I can picture myself outside, taking in the fresh air, and just letting go of some of that frustration. That sounds nice.\n\nBut then again, that voice pops up and says, \"What if it’s not as great as you hope?\" It’s like there’s a part of me that wants to just protect myself from disappointment. I guess I’m trying to balance that hope with the reality of my usual experience where things don’t always turn out the way I want. \n\nBut if I can just focus on the moment and not overthink it, maybe it could actually be a chance to feel a bit lighter. I guess I’ll just have to remind myself that it’s okay to have mixed feelings about it. I’m trying to stay open to the idea that it could be a nice break from my usual routine. It’s just a small step, after all.\nTherapist: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling a sense of hope about the potential for a positive experience during your walk. I appreciate your willingness to envision it as a moment to find some peace and let go of frustration, even if there’s that inner voice cautioning you about disappointment. It’s completely normal to have mixed feelings, and acknowledging both the hope and the fear is a significant part of this process. As you prepare for this small step, what would it look like for you to focus on the moment and enjoy the experience without overthinking? Additionally, how can you remind yourself to stay open to whatever feelings arise during that time?\nClient: I mean, focusing on the moment during the walk could look like just really being present, you know? Like maybe paying attention to my surroundings, like the trees or the sounds of the street, instead of getting caught up in my head. I think if I can keep my mind from racing, it might help me enjoy it a bit more. Maybe I could even set a little intention before I head out, like telling myself to just breathe and take it in.\n\nAs for reminding myself to stay open, I guess I could think about it as just taking a break instead of putting pressure on it to be something profound. I could keep some simple phrases in my mind, like \"Just take it one step at a time\" or \"It's okay to feel whatever I feel.\" That might help me not get stuck in my head and just experience it as it comes.\n\nBut I also worry that once I’m out there, I might forget all this and just fall back into my usual patterns of thinking. I guess it’s about trying to find that balance between being hopeful and being realistic. I just want to make it a moment that’s not tied to my usual frustrations. So, I’ll just have to see how it goes and be kind to myself about it.\nTherapist: It’s great to hear that you’re thinking about ways to be present during your walk and appreciate your surroundings. Setting an intention to breathe and take it in sounds like a wonderful approach to help you stay grounded. I also like your idea of using simple phrases to remind yourself to take it one step at a time and to be open to whatever feelings arise. It’s completely normal to worry about slipping back into old patterns, but acknowledging that concern is a positive step. As you prepare for this experience, what do you think you can do to gently remind yourself of these intentions when you’re out there? Additionally, how might you celebrate or acknowledge yourself afterward, regardless of how the walk goes?\nClient: I mean, to gently remind myself of those intentions while I'm out there, I guess I could try to take a moment before I start walking to really focus on my breath and ground myself. Maybe even say out loud one of those phrases, like “Just take it one step at a time,” just to set the tone. I could also leave my phone in my pocket so I'm not tempted to check it constantly, which might help me stay more present. \n\nAs for celebrating or acknowledging myself afterward, I think just giving myself a little pat on the back for even going out for the walk would be a start. Maybe I could jot down a quick note about how it felt, even if it’s just a couple of words. That way, I’m not just brushing it off, and I can reflect on it later. It could help reinforce the idea that I did something different, regardless of how it went. \n\nI just really want to make sure that I’m being kind to myself about it, you know? I guess it’s about finding those small wins and not overthinking what they mean. It’s a step, and I’m trying to keep it in perspective.\nTherapist: It sounds like you have some thoughtful strategies in place to help you stay present during your walk, like grounding yourself with your breath and setting a positive tone before you begin. I appreciate your intention to keep your phone in your pocket to minimize distractions; that can really help you connect with the moment. Acknowledging your efforts afterward, whether through a small pat on the back or jotting down your thoughts, is a wonderful way to reinforce those positive steps you’re taking. It’s clear that you’re aiming to treat yourself with kindness and recognize those small wins, which is an important part of this journey. As you get ready for this walk, what feelings or thoughts come up for you about the potential to create a positive experience for yourself?\nClient: I mean, thinking about creating a positive experience feels kind of exciting, you know? There’s a part of me that’s starting to think, “Maybe this could actually be a nice break.” Just picturing myself outside, breathing in the fresh air, it does feel like a chance to step away from all the frustration. \n\nBut then there’s that other side of me that worries. It’s like, what if I go out there and it doesn’t feel as good as I hope? I don’t want to set myself up for disappointment. But I guess I need to remember that it’s okay if it’s not perfect. Just taking that walk and being open to whatever happens could be a win in itself, right? \n\nI think I’m trying to find a balance between that hope and that nagging voice telling me it might not work out. But focusing on the moment and being kind to myself afterward makes it feel a little more manageable. I just want to remember that even if it doesn’t go exactly how I picture it, I’m still trying something different, and that’s worth acknowledging. So, yeah, I’m feeling a mix of hope and a bit of nervousness, but I think I’m ready to give it a shot.\nTherapist: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling a mix of excitement and hope about the potential for a positive experience during your walk. Acknowledging that it might not be perfect, but still being open to whatever happens is a healthy mindset. It’s clear that you’re working hard to find that balance between hope and the concerns that come up. As you prepare for this experience, can you identify any specific thoughts that make you doubt the effectiveness of the walk? Additionally, think about any past experiences where a small change led to a positive outcome for you. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts your belief about the walk? Lastly, how might you view the walk differently if you focus on the experience itself rather than the outcome?\nClient: I mean, when I think about the doubts, there’s that voice that says, “This is just another thing you’re trying, and what if it doesn’t change anything?” It’s frustrating because I want to believe that a walk can help, but I keep thinking about past times when I’ve tried to change things and it didn’t go the way I wanted. It’s like I’m conditioned to expect disappointment.\n\nBut then I also have moments where I’ve made small changes, like when I decided to cut back on drinking during the week. That felt good, and it showed me that I can make a difference in my routine. So I guess there’s evidence that small changes can lead to something positive, even if it’s not always immediate. \n\nIf I focus on the experience instead of the outcome, I think I could view the walk as just a moment for myself, rather than a test of whether I’m succeeding or failing. It’s more about taking that time to step away and breathe, rather than needing it to fix everything. I could remind myself that every little bit counts, and it’s okay if it’s not life-changing in that moment. Just being out there, trying something new, is a step in itself, right? So yeah, I think I’m starting to see it as more of a chance to just be.\nTherapist: It’s insightful to hear you reflect on those doubts and how they stem from past experiences. Acknowledging that you’ve had moments where small changes, like cutting back on drinking, have led to positive outcomes is a powerful reminder of your ability to make a difference in your routine. I appreciate your shift in perspective about the walk, viewing it as an opportunity for yourself rather than a measure of success or failure. Focusing on the experience itself, rather than the outcome, can help you embrace the moment and reduce the pressure you feel. As you prepare for this walk, what specific feelings or thoughts do you want to hold onto to help you stay present and engaged in the experience?\nClient: I think I want to hold onto that sense of curiosity about the experience, you know? Like, just being open to whatever comes up without having a specific expectation. I’d like to remind myself that it’s okay to just be there, taking it all in, and not overthinking things. \n\nI also want to focus on the feeling of stepping away from my usual frustrations and just enjoying a little moment of peace. Maybe I can think about how nice it is to be outside, breathing in the fresh air, and appreciating the little things around me, like the sounds or the sights. \n\nAnd I want to keep in mind that it’s about being kind to myself, no matter how it goes. Just telling myself that I’m doing something different, and that’s a positive step, even if it doesn’t feel like a big deal in the moment. I guess it’s about finding joy in the act of walking itself rather than needing it to solve anything. So yeah, I’ll try to hold onto those thoughts and feelings as I prepare for it.\nTherapist: It’s inspiring to hear that you want to embrace a sense of curiosity during your walk and focus on being present without specific expectations. That openness can really enhance your experience and allow you to appreciate the moment for what it is. I love that you’re planning to remind yourself of the simple joys, like the fresh air and the sights around you, as well as the importance of being kind to yourself regardless of the outcome. This approach can help you find value in the act of walking itself, which is a meaningful step forward. As you get ready for this, how do you feel about the balance between curiosity and the desire to step away from frustration?\nClient: I mean, finding that balance feels important, you know? I think curiosity can help me shift my focus away from the frustration and just allow myself to be in the moment. If I’m curious, I can let go of that pressure to feel a certain way or have a specific outcome. It’s like I’m giving myself permission to just explore my surroundings and see what comes up without judgment.\n\nAt the same time, I know those frustrations can still creep in, and I don’t want to ignore them either. But I guess if I approach it with curiosity, I might be able to acknowledge those feelings without letting them take over. It’s all about finding that middle ground where I can be aware of my emotions but not let them dictate my experience. \n\nSo, I feel hopeful that this balance could really help me make the most of the walk. I just want to remember that it’s okay for it to be a mix of emotions, and that’s part of being human. I think by holding onto that curiosity, I can create a space for myself to feel whatever I feel while still enjoying the experience.\nTherapist: It’s insightful to hear how you’re recognizing the importance of balancing curiosity with the acknowledgment of your frustrations. Embracing that curiosity can indeed create a space for you to explore your surroundings without the weight of expectations. It’s a healthy approach to allow yourself to feel a mix of emotions while still being present in the moment. As you prepare for your walk, what specific strategies do you think you can use to maintain that balance between curiosity and awareness of your feelings? Additionally, how might you remind yourself to stay open to whatever arises during your time outside?\nClient: I mean, I think I can keep it simple with some strategies to help maintain that balance. Like, maybe before I step outside, I could take a few deep breaths to ground myself and set that intention of curiosity. Just telling myself, “I’m here to explore, not to judge,” might help me stay open to what I see and feel.\n\nWhile I’m walking, I could focus on just noticing things around me—the colors of the leaves, the sounds of the street, or even just how the pavement feels under my feet. If those frustrations start creeping in, I guess I could acknowledge them, but then gently redirect my focus back to my surroundings. Like saying, “Okay, I see you frustration, but let’s just look at that tree over there instead.”\n\nTo remind myself to stay open, I could keep those phrases I thought of earlier in my mind, like “Just take it one step at a time.” Maybe even repeating them silently to myself if I start to feel overwhelmed. I think just allowing myself the freedom to feel whatever comes up, without trying to push it away, will help me keep that balance.\n\nI really want to give myself permission to just experience the walk for what it is, without putting too much weight on it. It’s a chance to step away and breathe, and I think I can hold onto that as I prepare to head out. So, yeah, I feel like these strategies can help me stay curious and aware without getting caught up in my usual patterns of thinking.\nTherapist: It’s encouraging to see how you’ve identified some practical strategies to maintain that balance between curiosity and awareness of your feelings. Taking deep breaths to ground yourself and setting the intention to explore without judgment is a wonderful way to start your walk. I appreciate your plan to focus on your surroundings and gently redirect your thoughts if frustrations arise; that shows a lot of self-compassion. Keeping those phrases in mind as reminders will also help reinforce your intention to stay present. As you prepare to take this step, what feelings do you anticipate experiencing during the walk, and how might you celebrate your efforts afterward, regardless of how it goes?\nClient: I mean, during the walk, I think I’ll probably experience a mix of feelings, right? I can see myself feeling a little excited at first, just being outside and taking in the fresh air. But I wouldn’t be surprised if some frustrations pop up too. It’s just part of my usual routine, you know? I might feel that nagging voice trying to pull me back into overthinking or dwelling on negative stuff. But I’m hoping that with my strategies in place, I can acknowledge those feelings without letting them take over.\n\nAs for celebrating my efforts afterward, I think just taking a moment to recognize that I actually got out there would be a win. Even if the walk feels tough or doesn’t go how I hoped, I want to give myself credit for trying something different. Maybe I could treat myself to something small, like a nice snack or just some time to relax afterward. I could also jot down a few notes about how it felt, just to reflect on my experience. It’s about acknowledging that I took that step, regardless of how it turned out, and being kind to myself about the whole process. So yeah, I’m feeling hopeful about it!\nTherapist: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re anticipating a mix of feelings during your walk, and it’s insightful that you recognize the potential for excitement alongside those familiar frustrations. Acknowledging that both can coexist is a healthy approach, and it sounds like you’re well-prepared to manage those feelings with your strategies. I appreciate your commitment to celebrating your efforts afterward, whether through a small treat or reflecting on your experience. This kind of self-recognition is important as you take this step. As you get ready for your walk, what final thoughts or feelings do you want to hold onto that will support you in this journey?\nClient: I think I want to hold onto that sense of openness and acceptance, you know? Just reminding myself that it’s okay to feel whatever comes up during the walk—whether it’s excitement, frustration, or anything in between. I want to focus on being present and curious, allowing myself to explore without judgment. \n\nAlso, I want to keep in mind that this is just one step in a bigger journey. It doesn’t have to be perfect; it’s about trying something new and giving myself the space to experience it fully. I really want to celebrate that effort, no matter the outcome, and just be kind to myself throughout the process.\n\nSo yeah, I guess it’s about embracing the moment, taking it all in, and giving myself permission to just be. I feel like holding onto these thoughts will help me navigate whatever comes up during the walk. I’m ready to give it a shot!\nTherapist: It’s inspiring to hear how you’re embracing openness and acceptance as you prepare for your walk. Holding onto the idea that it’s okay to experience a range of feelings, while focusing on being present and curious, will certainly enhance your experience. I appreciate your commitment to recognizing that this is just one step in your journey, and celebrating your efforts, regardless of the outcome, is a valuable mindset. As you move forward, remember that every moment you take to be kind to yourself is a significant part of this process. What are you feeling most excited about as you get ready to take this step?\nClient: I mean, I think I’m most excited about the possibility of just having a moment to myself, you know? It feels nice to think that I could step outside and enjoy a little peace away from the usual chaos in my head. Just being able to breathe in some fresh air and let my mind wander without all that pressure feels refreshing. \n\nI’m also looking forward to exploring my surroundings and noticing things I might usually overlook. It’s like I’m giving myself permission to just exist in that moment, without worrying about the past or what’s next. That sense of curiosity is something I’m really hoping to tap into.\n\nAnd honestly, I think it’ll be nice to celebrate just taking that step, even if it doesn’t go perfectly. It feels like a small win to me, and I want to remember that. So yeah, I’m excited to see how it goes and to just be kind to myself throughout the whole experience.\nTherapist: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling excited about the possibility of finding a moment of peace for yourself during the walk. Embracing that sense of curiosity and allowing yourself to explore your surroundings can truly enhance your experience. I appreciate your intention to celebrate taking that step, regardless of how it goes; recognizing those small wins is important for your journey. As you prepare to head out, can you recall a specific moment when you felt that sense of peace or curiosity before? What did that feel like for you?\nClient: I mean, I guess I can think back to a time when I went hiking a while ago. There was this moment when I was just standing at the top of a hill, looking out at the view. I could feel the wind on my face, and it was like everything else just faded away for a bit. I remember feeling so calm, like all the noise in my head just quieted down. I was really able to take in the beauty of the mountains and the trees around me. \n\nThat sense of peace felt really refreshing, like I was finally able to breathe and just exist without all the weight of my usual thoughts. I want to tap into that feeling during this walk, you know? Just letting myself be in the moment, appreciating my surroundings, and not overthinking. It’s definitely a good memory that I can hold onto as I prepare for this. I think it shows me that I can find that peace again, even if it’s just for a little while.\nTherapist: It’s beautiful to hear you reflect on that hiking experience and the sense of peace you felt at the top of the hill. That moment of calm, where everything else faded away, is a powerful reminder of the potential for similar feelings during your walk. Holding onto that memory as you prepare can help you reconnect with that sense of presence and appreciation for your surroundings. As you step out, how might you remind yourself to seek out that feeling of calm and curiosity, just like you experienced before?\nClient: I mean, I think I could start by just taking a moment before I even step outside to really breathe and visualize that feeling from the hike. Maybe I could picture myself at the top of that hill, with the wind on my face, and remind myself that it’s okay to let go of everything else for a bit. Just telling myself that it’s about being in the moment and appreciating what’s around me could help set the tone.\n\nWhile I’m walking, I could keep that memory in mind and try to replicate that sense of calm. Like, if I start feeling overwhelmed or frustrated, I can pause and take a few deep breaths, just like I did up there, and focus on the sounds and sights around me. I think I might even say something to myself like, “Remember that feeling of peace,” to pull me back to that mindset.\n\nAnd if I find myself getting lost in my thoughts, I could remind myself that it’s okay to just be curious about my surroundings, like I was back then. Just letting myself explore without pressure is key. I really want to give myself the space to reconnect with that sense of calm, even if it’s just for a little while. So yeah, I think those reminders will help me tap into that feeling as I get ready to head out.\nTherapist: It’s wonderful to hear how you plan to use that hiking memory as a source of inspiration for your walk. Visualizing that feeling of calm and allowing yourself to breathe deeply before stepping outside is a great way to set a positive tone. I appreciate your intention to replicate that sense of peace by focusing on your surroundings and taking pauses when needed. Reminding yourself to be curious and explore without pressure can truly enhance your experience. As you prepare to head out, what final thoughts or affirmations do you want to carry with you to support you in this journey?\nClient: I think I want to carry with me the idea that it's okay to just be in the moment, you know? I keep reminding myself that every feeling that comes up is valid, and I don’t have to push anything away. Something like, \"I'm allowed to take this time for myself,\" feels really important. \n\nAlso, I want to hold onto that affirmation of curiosity: “I’m here to explore, not to judge.” I feel like that will help me stay open and engaged with what I’m experiencing, rather than getting caught up in my head.\n\nAnd just remembering that even if it doesn’t go perfectly, I’m still taking a step, and that’s worth celebrating. I want to give myself permission to enjoy this experience, no matter how it unfolds. So yeah, those thoughts and affirmations will definitely guide me as I head out. I’m feeling ready to give it a shot!",
