  "conversation": "Therapist: Hi Alex, it’s good to see you. What’s been on your mind lately that brought you here today?\nClient: I don’t know, I guess just... family stuff, I suppose. It’s hard to talk about, you know? Like, my cousin invited me to his wedding, and I just felt this wave of anxiety hit me. I mean, I didn't even respond to the invitation. It’s just... I don't want to deal with the questions or... I don't know, the judgment. It’s like, no matter what I do, I feel like I can’t win.\nTherapist: You’re feeling a lot of anxiety about your cousin’s wedding invitation and the potential judgment or questions that might come with it, which makes it hard for you to respond. What do you think is the most challenging part about attending the wedding for you?\nClient: It's just... I don’t know, I guess it’s everything. The thought of being around family again, it makes me feel trapped. I mean, there’s always that pressure to explain myself, like why I haven’t done things the way they think I should. And then there's my mom, you know? I can just hear her voice in my head, saying something critical or making me feel small. It’s exhausting. I just don’t want to feel that way again.\nTherapist: It seems like the idea of being around your family brings up a lot of pressure and feelings of being trapped, especially with the critical voice of your mom echoing in your mind. Maybe there's a part of you that wants to avoid that exhaustion and the potential for feeling small again. Did I get that right?\nClient: Yeah, that sounds about right. It’s just... I feel like I can’t escape it. Like, every time I think about it, I just picture myself there, all those eyes on me, and I can practically hear her criticizing me. I know it shouldn’t matter, but somehow it does, you know? I just wish I could feel like I belong or that I’m accepted for who I am. But instead, it feels like I’m just this burden... like, what's the point in putting myself through that? It’s easier to just avoid it all.\nTherapist: It sounds like you’re really struggling with feelings of being a burden and the desire for acceptance, yet feeling trapped by the fear of judgment and criticism from your family. Maybe there's a part of you that wishes for a sense of belonging, but the thought of facing those critical eyes makes it feel overwhelming. Is that close to what you’re experiencing?\nClient: Yeah, that’s pretty much it. I mean, I just want to be accepted for who I am, but it feels like I can never live up to that. Every time I think about being around them, I just get this knot in my stomach. It's like I'm constantly being reminded of my past, all those times I felt rejected or not good enough. I don’t know... I just feel so sad thinking about it, but then I also feel this anger towards myself for letting it get to me. It's frustrating, you know? I just want to avoid that whole situation, but then I feel guilty for not being there for my cousin. It’s a mess.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're caught in a really difficult place, feeling both sadness and frustration about the situation with your family and your cousin's wedding. You mentioned feeling that knot in your stomach when you think about being around them, and it seems like those past experiences of rejection are really weighing on you. When you picture yourself in that situation, what thought comes to your mind most strongly in that moment?\nClient: I guess the strongest thought is just this overwhelming sense of dread. Like, I keep thinking, “What if they start asking me questions I can’t answer?” Or “What if my mom says something to embarrass me?” It’s like I can already feel that anxiety creeping in. I just picture myself standing there, feeling so out of place, like I don’t belong at all. And then I think, “They probably don’t even want me there. Why would they?” It’s like a loop of all these negative thoughts that just keeps playing in my head. It’s hard to shake off, you know?\nTherapist: When you think about being at the wedding and the anxiety that comes with it, one of the strongest thoughts you have is, “They probably don’t even want me there. Why would they?” It sounds like this thought really captures that sense of dread and feeling out of place. Can you say that thought again, just as it came to you?\nClient: They probably don’t even want me there. Why would they? It’s like... I just feel so unwanted in that family. I mean, I can’t help but think that nobody really cares if I show up or not. It just reinforces that feeling of being a burden, you know? Like, I don’t fit in, and it’s exhausting to even think about trying to be a part of it all.\nTherapist: It sounds like that thought, “They probably don’t even want me there. Why would they?” really reflects a deep sense of feeling unwanted and like a burden within your family. It’s understandable that this would create such exhaustion and frustration for you. When you think about that moment of feeling unwanted, what else comes to your mind?\nClient: I guess when I think about feeling unwanted, it just brings up all those memories of being bullied as a kid, you know? I was always the one who didn’t fit in, the one who got picked on because of my weight. It’s like that feeling never really went away. I mean, I thought coming to therapy would help me move past it, but here I am, still carrying all that baggage. It just makes everything feel heavier, like I’m stuck in this cycle of feeling rejected and unwanted. It’s frustrating because I want to break free from it, but then I get so overwhelmed by those old feelings that I end up shutting down. I just wish I could find a way to feel like I belong, even if it’s just for a moment.\nTherapist: When you reflect on feeling unwanted, it brings up those painful memories of being bullied as a kid and that sense of not fitting in. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of weight from those experiences, and it feels frustrating to still be dealing with those old feelings. When you think about being in that situation now, what thought comes to your mind most strongly in that moment?\nClient: I think the strongest thought that comes to mind is... \"Why can't I just be normal?\" Like, I see everyone else fitting in, laughing, enjoying themselves, and then there’s me, just trying to survive the moment. It’s like I’m stuck in this loop of comparing myself to everyone else. I just feel so out of place and... I don’t know, it’s like I’m always waiting for the moment when someone points out how different I am. I just want to blend in for once, to not feel like I have to prove anything or be someone I’m not. It’s exhausting just thinking about it, and then I feel angry at myself for letting those thoughts control me. It’s just... a mess, like I’m trapped in my own head.\nTherapist: You're feeling really trapped in that loop of comparison and the desire to just be normal, which makes it exhausting to even think about being in social situations. It sounds like that thought of wanting to blend in and not feel different is really weighing on you, and it’s understandable to feel angry at yourself for those thoughts. If we break this down, what do you think is the main obstacle for you in responding to your cousin's wedding invitation?\nClient: I think the main obstacle is just this overwhelming fear of judgment. Like, I can’t shake the thought that everyone will be looking at me, waiting for me to mess up or say something wrong. And then there’s the fear of my mom’s criticism, which just looms over everything. It’s like, I don’t want to put myself in a position where I feel that familiar pain of not being accepted, you know? I know I should probably just go and support my cousin, but the thought of facing all that negativity feels like too much. It’s easier to just avoid it altogether. But then I feel guilty for not being there, and it just adds to this whole mess of emotions. It’s like I’m stuck between wanting to go and feeling like I can’t handle it.\nTherapist: It sounds like the main obstacle for you is that overwhelming fear of judgment and your mom's criticism, which makes the idea of attending the wedding feel really daunting. You’re caught between wanting to support your cousin and the urge to avoid that negativity, which creates a lot of guilt and confusion. If we think about this situation, what are a couple of options you might consider for responding to the invitation?\nClient: I don’t know, I guess I could... maybe just send a message back saying I can’t make it? That feels like the easiest option, you know? Just avoid the whole thing. But then part of me thinks I should at least acknowledge the invitation. Maybe I could just say I’m busy or something. I just... I can’t shake the guilt of not being there for my cousin, but the thought of actually going is just too much. I don’t want to deal with all the questions or the judgment. It’s like, no matter what I choose, I still feel stuck. I don’t know what the right answer is.\nTherapist: You’re feeling really stuck between the desire to avoid the wedding and the guilt of not being there for your cousin. It sounds like sending a message to say you can’t make it feels like the easiest option, but you also recognize the importance of acknowledging the invitation. If we break this down into a few options, what feels most manageable as a first step for you? Would it be sending a message to your cousin, or is there another approach you’re considering?\nClient: I guess... sending a message feels like the easiest way to handle it. But then I think about how that might make my cousin feel, you know? I mean, I don't want to hurt him, but the thought of actually going and facing everything is just so overwhelming. It’s like I’m stuck in this loop of guilt and fear. I just don’t know if I can handle the pressure of being there. Maybe I could just... delay responding for a bit, you know? Just to buy myself some time. But then I feel bad for dragging it out. It’s just... it all feels complicated, and I really don’t want to deal with it right now. I mean, what if I say I’m busy and then he asks me again later? It’s just... ugh, I don’t know how to make this decision.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed by the pressure of making a decision about the invitation, and the idea of delaying your response feels like a way to buy some time. You’re caught between wanting to protect yourself from that pressure and not wanting to hurt your cousin’s feelings. If we consider your options, sending a message to acknowledge the invitation seems like a starting point. Would it feel manageable to send a brief message saying you appreciate the invite but need some time to think about it? What might that look like for you?\nClient: I mean, I guess that could work, right? Just a simple message saying I appreciate the invitation but need some time to think. It sounds... less intense than just saying I can't make it. But even that feels a bit scary, like I’m still leaving the door open for them to ask again, you know? I just worry about what they might say or how they’ll react. It’s like, I want to be honest but also not have to deal with the fallout of that honesty. I don’t know if I’m ready for that. But... maybe just acknowledging it is a step? It’s just so hard to figure out the right approach. I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I also don’t want to feel trapped. It’s a lot to think about. I guess I just need to take a moment to breathe before jumping into anything.\nTherapist: It sounds like acknowledging the invitation with a simple message feels like a less intense option for you, which is a positive step. I hear that you're still feeling some fear about how your cousin might react or the possibility of them asking again later. It’s understandable to want to be honest while also protecting yourself from feeling trapped. If we think about this, would it feel manageable to take a moment to draft that message when you're ready? What might that look like for you, and when do you think you could try sending it?\nClient: I mean, drafting the message sounds... okay, I guess. It feels like a step I could take without diving into all the pressure of actually going to the wedding. Maybe I could just say something like, \"Thanks for the invite, I really appreciate it, but I need to think about it.\" That way, I'm acknowledging it without committing to anything right away. \n\nBut even the thought of doing that makes me feel anxious. Like, what if they push for more details or ask why I’m hesitant? I just don’t want to deal with all that. It’s frustrating because I want to be supportive, but I also need to protect myself. \n\nI think I could maybe try to draft something tonight, just to get it out of my head. But I might need a little time to work up to actually sending it. I don’t know... I just wish it didn’t feel so complicated. It’s like I’m trying to balance being honest and not getting overwhelmed, and it’s hard to find that middle ground. But... yeah, taking a moment to breathe and then coming back to it sounds like a plan.\nTherapist: It sounds like drafting a message feels like a manageable step for you, and I appreciate you recognizing that balance between being honest and protecting yourself. It’s understandable to feel anxious about the possibility of your cousin asking for more details, but it seems like you’re finding a way to acknowledge the invitation without committing to anything right away. Taking some time to breathe and work up to sending that message tonight sounds like a good approach. \n\nWhen you think about drafting that message, what time do you think you might set aside to do it?\nClient: I think I could try to set aside some time later tonight, maybe after dinner. That way, I can have a bit of quiet time to think it through without feeling rushed. I mean, I just want to make sure I say the right thing, you know? I don’t want to overthink it too much, but I also don’t want to just throw something together last minute. Taking a bit of time to breathe and gather my thoughts feels like a good idea. I just hope I can keep that anxiety at bay while I do it. It’s just... a lot to juggle right now. But yeah, after dinner sounds like a plan.\nTherapist: Setting aside some quiet time after dinner to draft your message sounds like a thoughtful approach. It’s great that you’re prioritizing your feelings and wanting to find the right words without feeling rushed. Acknowledging that anxiety might creep in while you do it is also important, and it’s okay to take that time to breathe and gather your thoughts. As you prepare to draft the message, what do you think might help you manage that anxiety?\nClient: I think maybe just reminding myself that it’s okay to feel anxious about this could help. Like, I shouldn't expect to be completely calm while doing it. I might need to take breaks if I start feeling overwhelmed. Also, maybe I could write down a few points I want to include in the message beforehand, just to have a clearer idea of what I want to say. That way, I won’t feel so lost when I actually sit down to write it. \n\nI guess listening to some calming music or doing a few deep breathing exercises beforehand might help too, just to ease the tension a bit. It’s just... I really want to get this right, but I know I can’t control how they’ll react. If I can keep that in mind, maybe it’ll make it a little easier to handle. I just hope I can stay focused and not get too caught up in my head about it.\nTherapist: It sounds like you have some solid strategies in mind to help manage your anxiety while drafting the message. Reminding yourself that it’s okay to feel anxious is a great first step, and taking breaks if you start to feel overwhelmed can really support you. Writing down key points ahead of time will likely provide clarity and make the process feel less daunting. \n\nListening to calming music and practicing deep breathing exercises are also wonderful tools to help ease that tension. As you prepare to draft your message later, what would be your first step in setting up that calming environment for yourself?\nClient: I think the first step would be to create a quiet space for myself after dinner. I could find a spot where I won’t be distracted, maybe in my room or somewhere cozy. I’d turn off my phone notifications so I won’t get sidetracked by messages or anything else. Then, I can put on some calming music, something that helps me relax a bit. \n\nOnce I feel a little more settled, I can take a few deep breaths to help clear my mind before I start writing. Just having that little routine might help me feel more centered and ready to tackle the message without feeling overwhelmed. I guess it’s just about creating that little bubble of peace for myself, you know? It’s a small step, but I think it could make a difference.\nTherapist: Creating a quiet space for yourself sounds like a wonderful first step. It’s great that you’re thinking about minimizing distractions and setting up a calming environment with music and deep breathing. That little routine you described could really help you feel more centered and ready to approach the message without the weight of overwhelm. As you prepare for this, how do you think you’ll feel once you’ve taken those steps and drafted your message?\nClient: I think once I’ve taken those steps and drafted my message, I might feel a mix of relief and anxiety. Like, I’ll probably feel a sense of accomplishment for finally acknowledging the invitation, which is a step forward. But then there’s also that lingering worry about how my cousin will react or if I’ll get questions that I just don’t want to deal with. \n\nI guess it’ll be nice to have that weight lifted a bit, knowing I’ve at least said something. But I’m sure that anxiety might still hang around, and I’ll have to remind myself that I’m doing this for me, not to please anyone else. It’s just... it feels like a small victory, but I know I’ll have to keep working on managing those feelings. It’s just about taking it one step at a time, I suppose. I just hope I can stay focused on that and not let my mind spiral too much afterwards.\nTherapist: It sounds like you’re anticipating a mix of relief and anxiety once you’ve drafted your message, which is completely valid. Acknowledging the invitation is indeed a step forward, and it’s understandable that the worry about your cousin’s reaction might linger. Recognizing that you’re doing this for yourself is an important mindset to hold onto. \n\nAs you think about that small victory, it might help to remind yourself that it’s okay to feel those mixed emotions afterward. You’re taking it one step at a time, and that’s a significant approach. When you reflect on how you want to manage those feelings after sending the message, what do you think might help you stay grounded?\nClient: I think once I send the message, it might help to have a plan for how to distract myself for a bit. Like maybe watching a show or reading something that pulls me in so I’m not constantly thinking about how my cousin might react. I could also remind myself to focus on the positive side of things, like the fact that I took a step to communicate instead of just avoiding it. \n\nMaybe I could even jot down a few affirmations or reminders about why I did this, just to keep me grounded. Something like, \"I did this for myself,\" or \"It’s okay to feel anxious, but I’m moving forward.\" I think having that little bit of self-compassion will help me through the waves of anxiety that might come up. It’s like I need to give myself permission to feel whatever comes, but also to celebrate that I took action, even if it feels small. I guess it’s about finding that balance between acknowledging my feelings and not letting them take over.\nTherapist: It sounds like you have a thoughtful plan in place for managing your feelings after sending the message. Distracting yourself with a show or a book can be a great way to take your mind off the anticipation, and focusing on the positive aspects of your decision is really important. Writing down affirmations to remind yourself of your progress and the reasons behind your actions shows a lot of self-compassion, which can help ground you during those waves of anxiety. \n\nGiving yourself permission to feel whatever comes up while also celebrating your steps forward is a healthy balance to strive for. As you prepare to send that message tonight, what’s one affirmation or reminder you’d like to focus on that feels particularly meaningful for you?\nClient: I think one affirmation that feels particularly meaningful for me is, \"I am taking steps for my own well-being.\" It reminds me that this is about me and my journey, not just about how others perceive me. I want to hold onto that as I draft the message and after I send it. It’s so easy to get caught up in what everyone else might think, but I need to remember that I'm doing this to take care of myself. I think that will help me stay grounded and focused on my own needs, even if the anxiety creeps in. Just having that reminder might make it a little easier to handle whatever comes next.\nTherapist: That affirmation, \"I am taking steps for my own well-being,\" is powerful and really encapsulates your focus on self-care. It’s wonderful that you’re prioritizing your journey and recognizing the importance of your own needs. Holding onto that reminder can definitely help you navigate the anxiety that might arise. As you get ready to draft your message tonight, how do you feel about incorporating that affirmation into your calming routine? Would it be something you say to yourself before you start writing?\nClient: I think incorporating that affirmation into my calming routine sounds like a really good idea. Saying it to myself before I start writing could help set the right mindset, you know? It’s like a little reminder that I’m doing this for me, and it’s okay to feel whatever I’m feeling. I could maybe take a moment to breathe, say the affirmation a couple of times, and let that sink in before I dive into drafting the message. \n\nI feel like it would help me feel more centered and less overwhelmed. Just focusing on my own well-being might ease some of that anxiety, even if it’s just a little. It’s about taking that step and acknowledging my feelings without letting them take control. I guess it’s all about finding that balance, and this affirmation could really support me in doing that.\nTherapist: It’s great to hear that you’re planning to incorporate your affirmation into your calming routine before drafting the message. Taking a moment to breathe and remind yourself that you’re doing this for your own well-being can really help center you and ease some of that anxiety. It sounds like you’re finding a way to acknowledge your feelings while also taking control of the situation, which is a positive step. \n\nAs you prepare for this, what do you think will be the most important thing to keep in mind while you’re drafting the message?\nClient: I think the most important thing to keep in mind while I’m drafting the message is that it’s okay to feel anxious, but I need to focus on being honest and true to myself. I want to remind myself that I’m not obligated to share everything or explain myself in detail. Just acknowledging the invitation is a step forward, and I have the right to set boundaries for my own well-being. \n\nAlso, I need to remember that it’s perfectly fine to take my time with this. I don’t have to rush or put too much pressure on myself to get it perfect. Just getting my thoughts down in a way that feels authentic to me is what matters. If I can keep that in mind, I think it’ll help me navigate that anxiety and make the process feel a little less daunting. I guess it’s about being kind to myself throughout this whole thing.\nTherapist: You’ve identified some really important points to keep in mind while drafting your message. Acknowledging that it’s okay to feel anxious and focusing on being honest and true to yourself will help you navigate this process. Setting boundaries for your well-being is essential, and it’s great that you’re allowing yourself the time to express your thoughts authentically without the pressure of perfection. \n\nBeing kind to yourself throughout this is a valuable mindset to hold onto. As you prepare to draft your message later, what’s one small way you can remind yourself to stay compassionate during this process?\nClient: I think one small way I can remind myself to stay compassionate during this process is to keep a little note nearby while I’m drafting the message. Just something simple that says, \"Be gentle with yourself,\" or maybe even a reminder of my affirmation. I could also set a timer for short breaks while I’m writing, so if I start to feel overwhelmed, I can step away for a moment to breathe and regroup. \n\nI think taking those little pauses could help me check in with myself and remind me that it’s okay to feel whatever I’m feeling. Just having that note or a little reminder around could serve as a gentle nudge to treat myself with kindness, especially if I start to get caught up in my thoughts. It’s about creating that space for self-compassion, you know?\nTherapist: That sounds like a wonderful plan. Keeping a note nearby with reminders like \"Be gentle with yourself\" or your affirmation can serve as a great anchor during the drafting process. Setting a timer for breaks is also a smart way to give yourself permission to step back and breathe when needed. It’s all about creating that supportive environment for yourself, and those little pauses can really help you stay grounded. As you think about this approach, how do you feel about having those reminders in place while you work on your message tonight?\nClient: I feel pretty good about having those reminders in place while I work on my message tonight. It’s comforting to think that I’ll have something tangible to look at when I start feeling overwhelmed. Just knowing that I can take a break and step away if I need to gives me a bit more confidence. I guess it makes the whole process feel less daunting, like I’m not just throwing myself into it without any support. \n\nHaving those little notes to guide me is a nice way to remind myself that it’s okay to take my time and be kind to myself. I think it’ll help me focus on what I need to say without getting too caught up in the anxiety. Overall, it feels like a more manageable way to approach this, and that gives me a bit of relief. I’m just hoping I can stick to that plan and remember to be gentle with myself throughout the whole thing.\nTherapist: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling more confident about having those reminders in place. Knowing you have tangible support to look at when you start feeling overwhelmed can really help ease some of that pressure. It sounds like you’re creating a thoughtful approach that prioritizes your well-being, which is so important. \n\nTaking your time and allowing yourself to be kind throughout this process will definitely make it feel more manageable. As you prepare to draft your message tonight, what do you think will be the most helpful way to remind yourself to stick to that plan and be gentle with yourself?\nClient: I think the most helpful way to remind myself to stick to that plan and be gentle with myself will be to set a clear intention before I start. I could take a moment to sit quietly and really think about what I want to achieve with this message, focusing on my affirmation and the idea of self-compassion. Maybe I could even say it out loud a couple of times to really let it sink in.\n\nAlso, I could set a couple of reminders on my phone or write down my affirmation and put it where I’ll see it while I’m drafting. Just having that little nudge to breathe and be kind to myself could make a difference. I think it’s about creating those little checkpoints during the process, so I can pause and check in with how I’m feeling. If I can keep that intention in mind, it might help me stay focused on what really matters and not let the anxiety take over. I guess it’s just about being gentle and giving myself that space to breathe.\nTherapist: Setting a clear intention before you start is a powerful way to ground yourself in this process. Taking a moment to focus on your affirmation and the concept of self-compassion can really help set a positive tone for drafting your message. Writing down your affirmation and placing it where you can see it is a great idea, as it will serve as a helpful reminder to breathe and be kind to yourself. \n\nCreating those little checkpoints to pause and check in with your feelings is a smart approach, allowing you to stay connected to your needs while navigating any anxiety that arises. As you get ready for tonight, what do you think will be the most important aspect of your intention that you want to carry with you into the drafting process?\nClient: I think the most important aspect of my intention that I want to carry with me into the drafting process is the idea of self-compassion. I really want to remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious and that I don’t have to be perfect in what I say. Just being honest and true to myself is what matters most. I want to focus on taking care of my own well-being, rather than getting caught up in how others might perceive my message. \n\nI think if I can keep that self-compassion front and center, it’ll help me navigate any discomfort that comes up while I’m writing. I also want to remind myself that this is a step forward for me, no matter how small it may feel. Embracing that mindset might ease some of the pressure and help me approach it with more confidence. So, yeah, holding onto that self-compassion and the understanding that I’m doing this for myself feels really important.\nTherapist: It’s wonderful to see how clearly you’re identifying the importance of self-compassion in this process. Keeping that focus on being honest and true to yourself, while also acknowledging that it’s okay to feel anxious, will definitely help you navigate any discomfort that arises. Recognizing that this is a step forward, no matter how small, is a powerful mindset to embrace. \n\nAs you prepare to draft your message tonight, how do you think you’ll remind yourself to stay connected to that self-compassion if you start to feel overwhelmed?\nClient: I think if I start to feel overwhelmed while drafting my message, I’ll try to pause for a moment and take a few deep breaths. Just stepping back for a second to breathe can help me reset my mind. I might also remind myself to read my affirmation out loud or even look at that note I’ve prepared, just to ground myself in that self-compassion mindset. \n\nI could visualize what it means to be gentle with myself, maybe even picture how I’d talk to a friend if they were in my shoes—like, I wouldn’t want to be harsh or critical, so why should I do that to myself? I might even jot down a quick reminder to myself that it’s okay to make mistakes or take my time. Just having those little strategies in place might help me reconnect with that sense of compassion and ease some of that anxiety. It’s like creating a little buffer for myself, so I don’t get too lost in the moment.\nTherapist: It sounds like you have some effective strategies in place to reconnect with that self-compassion if you start to feel overwhelmed. Pausing to take a few deep breaths and reminding yourself of your affirmation can really help ground you in those moments. Visualizing how you would support a friend in a similar situation is a beautiful way to cultivate that kindness towards yourself. \n\nJotting down quick reminders that it’s okay to make mistakes and take your time is also a smart approach. Creating that buffer for yourself will provide the space you need to navigate any anxiety that arises. As you get ready to draft your message tonight, what’s one thing you’re feeling hopeful about in this process?\nClient: I feel hopeful about being able to express myself honestly in the message. It’s nice to think that I’m finally taking a step towards reconnecting with my family, even if it feels a bit scary. I’m hopeful that acknowledging the invitation will not only help me move forward but also give me a sense of empowerment. Just knowing that I’m prioritizing my well-being and taking control of my own narrative is encouraging. I think that feeling of accomplishment, regardless of how they respond, will be a big boost for me. It’s like I’m reclaiming a part of myself that I’ve let slip away for too long. So, I’m looking forward to that sense of achievement, even if the process feels a bit rocky.\nTherapist: It’s inspiring to hear how hopeful you are about expressing yourself honestly and taking that step towards reconnecting with your family. Acknowledging the invitation truly does sound empowering, and it’s wonderful that you’re prioritizing your well-being and reclaiming your narrative. That sense of accomplishment, regardless of the response, is a significant victory for you. \n\nAs you prepare for this process, how do you think you’ll celebrate that feeling of achievement once you’ve drafted and sent your message?\nClient: I think once I’ve drafted and sent my message, I’ll celebrate that feeling of achievement by treating myself to something that I enjoy. Maybe I could order my favorite food or watch a movie I’ve been wanting to see. Just doing something that feels like a reward for taking that step could help reinforce the progress I’ve made. \n\nI might also take a moment to reflect on what I’ve done—like maybe jotting down how I felt during the process or what I learned about myself. Just acknowledging that I took action, regardless of how it all turns out, feels important. I think celebrating those small victories will help me remember that I’m moving forward, even if it’s just one step at a time. It’s like giving myself permission to feel proud of what I’ve accomplished, no matter how small it might seem.\nTherapist: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re thinking about ways to celebrate your achievement after sending the message. Treating yourself to something you enjoy, like your favorite food or a movie, sounds like a great way to acknowledge your progress. Reflecting on how you felt during the process and what you learned about yourself will also help reinforce that sense of accomplishment. \n\nRecognizing those small victories is so important, and it’s clear that you’re committed to moving forward, one step at a time. As you prepare for this evening, what’s one specific way you’d like to incorporate that celebration into your routine after you send the message?\nClient: I think one specific way I’d like to incorporate that celebration into my routine after I send the message is to set aside some time for myself, maybe an hour or so, to really enjoy whatever I choose to do. I could make a little ritual out of it—like lighting a candle or playing my favorite music while I eat my food or watch the movie. \n\nThat way, it feels more special, like I’m really honoring the step I took. I could even take a moment to reflect on the whole experience, jotting down a few thoughts about how it felt to finally send that message, and what it means for me moving forward. I think that kind of intentionality would help me savor the moment and remind myself of the progress I’ve made. Just creating that space to celebrate feels important, especially since it’s a step towards reconnecting with my family and prioritizing my well-being.",
