It’s like, what if I go out there and it doesn’t feel as good as I hope? I don’t want to set myself up for disappointment. But I guess I need to remember that it’s okay if it’s not perfect. Just taking that walk and being open to whatever happens could be a win in itself, right? \n\nI think I’m trying to find a balance between that hope and that nagging voice telling me it might not work out. But focusing on the moment and being kind to myself afterward makes it feel a little more manageable. I just want to remember that even if it doesn’t go exactly how I picture it, I’m still trying something different, and that’s worth acknowledging.

It’s like I’m conditioned to expect disappointment.\n\nBut then I also have moments where I’ve made small changes, like when I decided to cut back on drinking during the week.

I appreciate your intention to replicate that sense of peace by focusing on your surroundings and taking pauses when needed. Reminding yourself to be curious and explore without pressure can truly enhance your experience. As you prepare to head out, what final thoughts or affirmations do you want to carry with you to support you in this journey?"

I keep reminding myself that every feeling that comes up is valid, and I don’t have to push anything away. Something like, \"I'm allowed to take this time for myself,\" feels really important. \n\nAlso, I want to hold onto that affirmation of curiosity: “I’m here to explore, not to judge.” I feel like that will help me stay open and engaged with what I’m experiencing, rather than getting caught up in my head.\n\nAnd just remembering that even if it doesn’t go perfectly, I’m still taking a step, and that’s worth celebrating. I want to give myself permission to enjoy this experience, no matter how it unfolds. So yeah, those thoughts and affirmations will definitely guide me as I head out. I’m feeling ready to give it a shot!"
