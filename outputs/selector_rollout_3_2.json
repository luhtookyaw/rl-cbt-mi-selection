It’s like this pressure to measure up, and when I don’t, it just reinforces this belief that I’m not competent. \n\nAs for \"doing enough,\" I guess I’ve always thought it meant being productive, like publishing papers and getting recognition. But when I see others achieving that, I just feel... inadequate. I don’t really know what my own version of success looks like, honestly. It’s hard to even think about that when I’m constantly spiraling into these comparisons.\n\nAnd the steps? I mean, I could try to focus on my own work more, but it’s tough when my mind keeps drifting back to what everyone else is doing. It feels like I’m just stuck in this cycle of ruminating and procrastinating. I don’t know... I guess I just feel overwhelmed thinking about it all."

I know I’ve achieved things—there's feedback from my advisor that acknowledges my work, and I've had moments where I felt really engaged in my research.

It’s just tough to remember to do that in the moment, you know? I guess I could try to make it a habit, maybe even set reminders for myself. But it feels like one more thing on my plate, and I worry about adding to my stress instead of alleviating it.\n\nIt’s frustrating because I want to feel that sense of progress more consistently, but it’s like I’m fighting against this tide of self-doubt. Still, I do see the value in these ideas. Maybe if I can remind myself more often that I have made strides, it might help shift my perspective a bit.

This way, it becomes a part of your routine rather than an added stressor.
