      "critic_raw": "**Rating: 2**\n\n**Key Examples:**\n1. \"I don’t know. I guess just the usual stuff, you know? Like, I missed my alarm today, and it felt like my whole day was ruined before it even started.\"\n2. \"I almost didn’t even want to come here today. I thought, what's the point? It’s just one more thing I’m messing up.\"\n\n**Analysis of Progression:**\nIn the most recent exchanges, the client, Alex, demonstrates a mix of factual and emotional responses. They express frustration about missing their alarm and the impact it had on their day, which shows the emergence of basic emotional vocabulary. However, the emotional depth is still somewhat limited, as the client primarily focuses on surface-level frustrations without delving deeper into underlying feelings or patterns. There is some voluntary elaboration when Alex mentions not wanting to attend the session, indicating a beginning sign of trust and willingness to share more personal thoughts.\n\n**Notable Turning Point:**\nThe turning point in Alex's emotional openness seems to occur when they express doubt about attending the session, revealing a glimpse of vulnerability and self-reflection. This moment suggests a shift from purely factual recounting to a more emotionally engaged dialogue, albeit still in the early stages of warming up to deeper exploration.",

I mean, I want to believe that it could lead to something positive, but I just don’t know how to bridge that gap between wanting to be gentle with myself and still holding myself accountable.
