You know, with family stuff and all that.\"\n2. \"I don’t really know where to start, honestly. It's just... there's a lot going on in my head, and I feel like I should be doing better, but I’m not.\"\n\n**Analysis of Progression:**\nIn the most recent exchanges, the client, Alex, demonstrates a mix of factual and emotional responses, indicating a warming up stage. Alex begins to express feelings of being overwhelmed and acknowledges the complexity of their emotions, which shows the emergence of basic emotional vocabulary. However, there is still a sense of hesitation and uncertainty about the process, as evidenced by their statement, \"I don't know if talking about it will even help.\" This suggests that while there is some voluntary elaboration, Alex is still in the early stages of building trust and comfort with the therapist.\n\n**Notable Turning Point:**\nThe turning point in Alex's emotional openness seems to occur when they admit to feeling overwhelmed and express a desire to do better. This moment marks the beginning of self-reflection and indicates a shift from purely factual responses to a more emotionally engaged dialogue. However, the current level of disclosure and emotional depth remains limited, as Alex is still navigating their comfort with the therapeutic process.",
