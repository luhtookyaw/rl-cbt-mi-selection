It’s like I can hear her voice in my head, saying all those critical things she always does. And honestly, it feels like they don't really want me there anyway. Like I’m just a burden, you know? \n\nThe whole idea just makes me anxious and... sad, I guess. I’d rather just avoid it entirely.

That shift in perspective could indeed provide some relief when you think about attending the wedding. Let’s take a moment to explore how this understanding could impact your feelings. \n\nWhat would it look like for you to hold onto that thought—that their views aren’t the complete truth—when you’re at the wedding? How might that empower you to engage differently with your family? And as you consider this, what feelings arise about your decision to attend or not attend the wedding?",

Maybe I could remind myself that their judgments don’t define who I am, and that could give me a little more confidence to engage with my family. I could try to focus on the good moments, like connecting with my cousin or even just enjoying the celebration. \n\nBut honestly, I still feel that heaviness in my chest. It’s like I want to believe that I can handle it, but I’m still scared of how I'll feel when I’m actually there. I can picture myself getting caught up in my head again, feeling judged and unwanted, and it just makes me want to retreat. \n\nThinking about attending is definitely stressful, especially when I know I could just avoid it altogether. But then there's that part of me that feels guilty for not being there for my cousin. I guess I’m just torn between wanting to be part of the family and fearing that I’ll be reminded of all the reasons I feel out of place. It’s just frustrating to think about all of this, you know? I wish it didn’t feel so complicated."

Like, if someone asks about my job or weight, I could say something like, “I’m working on things at my own pace.” It’s not too revealing, but it shows I’m moving forward without getting into the nitty-gritty. \n\nSetting a time limit sounds good too. Just knowing I have an out could help take some pressure off. Maybe I could plan to stay for an hour or two, enjoy the highlights, and then leave. That way, I could focus on the positive interactions—like catching up with my cousin or sharing some laughs with family. \n\nI just hope I can keep that mindset when I’m there. It’s a lot to juggle, and while I want to be part of the celebration, I’m still worried about slipping back into those old feelings of being unwanted.

That way, it’ll be a constant reminder.\n\nCreating a list of positive interactions I hope to have sounds good too. I think I’ll jot down things like catching up with my cousin and enjoying the food, maybe even sharing some laughs with other family members. Just focusing on those moments can help shift my mindset.\n\nAs for engaging with my cousin, I could think of a few conversation starters. Something simple like asking him how he’s been or what his plans are after the wedding could work. I could also suggest we take a picture together or even share a fun memory from when we were younger. It feels nice to have some concrete ideas for how to connect.\n\nOverall, I think these steps will help me feel more prepared and focused on the positive aspects of the wedding. I really want to make the most of it, so having these strategies in place feels like a step in the right direction. Thank you for helping me work through all of this; it truly means a lot."

I feel like I have to prepare for that kind of judgment, and it’s exhausting. I know I shouldn’t let it affect me so much, but it feels impossible to escape that feeling of being unwanted.

If I start feeling overwhelmed, I could just take a moment to step aside and breathe. That might help me reset a bit.\n\nAs for handling uncomfortable questions, I guess I could prepare a few simple responses in advance. Like, if someone asks about my job or weight, I could say something like, “I’m working on things at my own pace.” It’s not too revealing, but it shows I’m moving forward without getting into the nitty-gritty. \n\nSetting a time limit sounds good too. Just knowing I have an out could help take some pressure off. Maybe I could plan to stay for an hour or two, enjoy the highlights, and then leave. That way, I could focus on the positive interactions—like catching up with my cousin or sharing some laughs with family. \n\nI just hope I can keep that mindset when I’m there. It’s a lot to juggle, and while I want to be part of the celebration, I’m still worried about slipping back into those old feelings of being unwanted. But I guess if I can hold onto my worth and focus on the connections, it could make the experience a bit more bearable. "
