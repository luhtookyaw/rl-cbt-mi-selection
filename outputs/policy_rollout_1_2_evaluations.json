        "guided_discovery": "4, The therapist primarily used guided discovery techniques, such as asking questions to explore the client's thoughts and feelings, and encouraging the client to consider alternatives and weigh advantages and disadvantages. However, the therapist did not achieve an excellent balance between skillful questioning and other modes of intervention, as the client repeatedly expressed a desire to shift the conversation away from the heavy topics, indicating that the guided discovery was not entirely effective in facilitating self-reflection and insight.",
        "focus": "2, The therapist attempted to elicit specific thoughts and behaviors by asking about the client's reactions to missing the alarm and exploring the client's feelings of defeat and frustration. However, the therapist struggled to find a focus and repeatedly returned to the same line of questioning, which the client resisted. The therapist did not effectively address the client's key cognitions or behaviors that needed change, as the client consistently expressed a desire to move away from the topic.",
        "strategy": "2, The therapist attempted to use cognitive-behavioral techniques by exploring the client's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to stress and setbacks. However, the overall strategy for promoting change was vague and did not seem promising in helping the client, as the client repeatedly expressed a desire to avoid the topic and shift to lighter subjects. The therapist did not effectively address the client's resistance or provide a clear, actionable plan for change.",
        "understanding": "4, The therapist generally seemed to grasp the client's internal reality, as they acknowledged the client's feelings of frustration, defeat, and exhaustion. The therapist reflected on the client's desire to avoid heavy topics and recognized the client's awareness of their patterns. However, the therapist did not fully explore the more subtle aspects of the client's communication, such as the depth of the client's hopelessness and the potential impact of their inner voice of doubt. While the therapist demonstrated good listening and empathic skills, there were missed opportunities to delve deeper into the client's internal struggles.",
        "interpersonal": "4, The therapist displayed a satisfactory degree of warmth, concern, confidence, genuineness, and professionalism. However, there were moments where the therapist could have been more attuned to the client's repeated requests to shift the conversation to a lighter topic. While the therapist was not destructive and maintained a professional demeanor, there was a lack of optimal responsiveness to the client's expressed needs, which prevented a higher score.",
        "collaboration": "2, The therapist attempted to collaborate with the client by exploring the client's feelings and thoughts about their struggles and suggesting small steps for change. However, the therapist had difficulty defining a problem that the client considered important, as the client repeatedly expressed a desire to shift the focus to lighter topics. The therapist did not fully establish a collaborative goal-setting process that the client was engaged in, nor did they successfully encourage the client to take an active role in decision-making during the session."
